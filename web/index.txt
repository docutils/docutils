===================================
 Docutils: Documentation Utilities
===================================
---------------------------------------------------------
 Written in Python, for General- and Special-Purpose Use
---------------------------------------------------------

Docutils is an open-source text processing system for processing
plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as HTML, LaTeX,
man-pages, open-document or XML.
It includes reStructuredText_, the easy to read, easy to use,
what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup language.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
========

**To get up & running quickly**, see the Quick-Start_ section of the
README_ file.

All **documentation** can be reached from the `Docutils Project
Documentation Overview`_.

To the developers of an open source project, **feedback** is a great
motivator and is very welcome.  We also rely on feedback for
determining what features to implement.  Thus, if you tell us what you
need, you may just get it!  Please post any feedback to the
docutils-users_ mailing list.

All **discussion** about Docutils takes place on the `mailing lists`_.

If you find a **bug**, please file a `bug report`_ or send email to
the docutils-users_ mailing list.  **Patch** submissions should be
filed in the `patch tracker`_ (preferred) or sent to docutils-develop_
(where you may be asked to send them to the `patch tracker`_).

We welcome all kinds of **contributions**.  There's a `To Do list`_
full of interesting ideas awaiting a champion.  If you have any
questions regarding how to extend Docutils, please feel free to ask on
the docutils-develop_ mailing list.

The only **requirement** for running Docutils is Python_

* After subversion commit r8378 (thanks to Stephen Finucane) the code is compatible
  with both Python 2 and Python 3.

* 0.15 is the last to support Python 2.6, 3.3, and 3.4.
* Docutil 0.14 dropped Python 2.4, 2.5, 3.1 and 3.2.
* Docutils 0.10 dropped Python 2.3 support.
* From version 0.6, Docutils is compatible with Python 3 (see README_ for
  details).
* For Docutils 0.5, Python 2.2.1+ is required.
* Up to Docutils 0.4, Python 2.1 is required.

Docutils is in active development and APIs should be considered 
**experimental** subject to change at any time.  Although *any time* is a time 
after serious thought and discussion.


Download
========

`Release packages`_ can be downloaded from PyPI_. They are mostly intended
for distributors.  See the `release notes`_ for a list of changes since the
previous release.

We recommend that you use a snapshot_ from `Docutils' Subversion
repository`_. The snapshots usually contain *more features* and *fewer bugs*
than the "official" releases |---| they're not only for developers!

.. Note::

   Snapshots are supported by sourceforge directly.
   The whole trunk is packed docutils, sandbox, prest/perl and web:

     https://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/code/HEAD/tarball

   or only the docutils package:

     http://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/docutils/

  Click the download snapshot button.

  The snapshosts listed below are created on website updates.

.. _release packages: https://pypi.org/project/docutils/#files
.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org

.. _release notes: RELEASE-NOTES.html

The Sandbox_ contains experimental, contributed code. You can download a
complete `snapshot of the Sandbox`_ or `browse the Sandbox`_ to download a
subset.
