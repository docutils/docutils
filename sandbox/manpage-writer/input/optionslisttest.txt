- a section header directly following the list must *not* be
  intentend.

This file tests this.

OPTIONS

This line must be in indented.

-o x   an option
-b     another

       This option does the following points:

       * one point

       * second point

          --ccc     option lists may be nested, even if this is rarely
	             used.


-k     and even another

       This option does the following points:

-o x   an option
-b     another

-m MESSAGE, --message=MESSAGE  The message to display (beaware of ``,``) 

EXAMPLES

The "Examples" section header must not be intented. But this paragraph
is indented, as all text in man-pages. This is level 0.

* Now let's test nested lists. 

  Line indented once. This is level 1.

  * Nested item1.
  * Nested item2.
  * Nested item3.

    Line for Nested item 3.

  * Nested item4.
 
  Paragraph at level 1. Same level as Line indented once.

This paragraph should be at level 0.
