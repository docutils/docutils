       OptionlistTest - Test for correct intention/detention of option lists

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       After an option list:

        a paragraph within the same section must be intented

        a section header directly following the list must _n_o_t be intentend.

       This file tests this.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       This line must be in indented.

       --oo _x   an option

       --bb     another

              This option does the following points:

               one point

               second point

                   ----cccccc  option  lists  may be nested, even if this is rarely
                          used.

       --kk     and even another

              This option does the following points:

               one point

               second point

       For all other options see ----hheellpp. This line must be intented.

       --oo _x   an option

       --bb     another

              The message to display (beaware of ,,)

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The "Examples" section header must not be intented. But this  paragraph
       is indented, as all text in man-pages. This is level 0.

        Now let's test nested lists.

         Line indented once. This is level 1.

          Nested item1.

          Nested item2.

          Nested item3.

           Line for Nested item 3.

          Nested item4.

         Paragraph at level 1. Same level as Line indented once.

       This paragraph should be at level 0.
