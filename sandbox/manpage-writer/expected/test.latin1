       This is a line block.  It ends with a blank line.
         Each new line begins with a vertical bar ("|").
         Line breaks and initial indents are preserved.
       Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
       they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
         The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
         the left edge of the text above it.

       This is a second line block.

       Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".

          Half a bee, philosophically,
            must, _i_p_s_o _f_a_c_t_o, half not be.

            _v_i_s _a _v_i_s its entity.  D'you see?

          But can a bee be said to be
            or not to be an entire bee,
              when half the bee is not a bee,
                due to some ancient injury?
