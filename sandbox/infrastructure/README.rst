The `infrastructure <.>`_ sandbox directory stores any scripts that
are needed for the development of the Docutils project.

:`<releasing-log.txt>`_: What happend at release time ... what to do next time
    better.

:`<docutils-update.local>`_: The script to update the `web site`_
    from a developer machine or on shell.sourceforge.

    If a file ``ON_SOURCEFORGE`` exists in current directory, the
    script assumes being executed on shell.sourceforge.

:`<htmlfiles.lst>`_: The list of files .html-files that should be
    generated from .rst/.txt files by ``docutils-update.local``
    and old ``update-htmlfiles`` which are not generated by the script
    already.

:`<set_version.sh>`_: Script to change the version identifier in
    documentation, tests, docutils/__init__, ...
    extracted from ``release.sh``.


Everything below this line needs rework
---------------------------------------

is not in use ... move to attic.

:`<release.sh>`_: The script to make releases of Docutils.
    For usage details see `release.txt`_

    TODO : test. 
      Allow release without testing, because tests must be done
      on more than one os.

:`<uploaddocutils.sh>`_: Upload files to http://docutils.sf.net/tmp/
    using ``scp``, inserting the current date in the file name.

and are these used by anyone.

:`<dbackport.sh>`_: Back-port changes from the trunk to the
    maintenance branch.

:`<fsfsbackup.sh>`_: Backup (mirror) an FSFS Subversion repository via
    SSH.  Used to backup the `Docutils Subversion repository`_.
