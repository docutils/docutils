    The depression, which brought so many changes in retailing, favored these types 
    of retail outlets (chain stores). The consumers had their eyes on prices. They 
    still wanted things. They desired to keep up their standards of living with reduced 
    incomes. Shopping was a job that the consumer was willing to work at. 

    --Edward A. Filene, 1937
