* An item on level 1

  * An item on level 2

    Some normal text

  * One more on 2

    * Down to 3

      Text for 3

* Back to 1

  * Again 2

  * In reST this is a list containing a list as first item

  * This should merge with the previous list

    * Constructs like this come from Powerpoint or Word

    * They are legal even in ODF

    * Although this is not possible really in reST

* And the element on level 1 should just be there, too
