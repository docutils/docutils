The Modernize Main Street campaign created during the Depression years
represented a significant effort to revitalize the central business dis-
tricts of American communities [#note1]_. 

Promoted through trade journals and design competitions, the 
idea of updating commercial buildings with modern materials and streamlined 
design was therefore, one way of renewing citizen’s interest in
consumption [#note2]_.

Prior to the 1920s, most American citizens tended to “make do” and reuse
material goods instead of purchasing new items each year [#note4]_. 

Advertising strategies to convince people to buy products that were not
absolute necessities for daily life (or were absolutely needed at the time)
soon became the focus of marketing executives [#note5]_. 

Popular magazines with mass distribution like *Ladies’ Home Journal* and *The
Saturday Evening Post* dis- played suggestive advertisements instilling a
desire for consumable products.  Marketing ideas based on planned obsolescence
and repackaged goods encour- aged a development of this “modern” consumer
culture [#note6]_.

An increased cultural emphasis on consumption as a capitalist value challenged
Puritan morals which began to decline by the end of the 1920s [#note7]_.
