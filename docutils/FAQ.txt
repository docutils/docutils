Docutils
========

What is Docutils?
-----------------

Docutils_ is a system for processing plaintext documentation into
useful formats, such as HTML, XML, and TeX.  It supports multiple
types of input, such as standalone files (implemented), inline
documentation from Python modules and packages (under development),
`PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)`_ (implemented), and others as
discovered.

For an overview of the Docutils project implementation, see `PEP
258`_, "Docutils Design Specification".

Docutils is implemented in Python_.

Why is it called "Docutils"?
----------------------------

Docutils is short for "Python Documentation Utilities".  The name
"Docutils" was inspired by "Distutils", the Python Distribution
Utilities architected by Greg Ward, a component of Python's standard
library.

The earliest known use of the term "docutils" in a Python context was
a `fleeting reference`__ in a message by Fred Drake on 1999-12-02 in
the Python Doc-SIG mailing list.  It was suggested `as a project
name`__ on 2000-11-27 on Doc-SIG, again by Fred Drake, in response to
a question from Tony "Tibs" Ibbs: "What do we want to *call* this
thing?".  This was shortly after David Goodger first `announced
reStructuredText`__ on Doc-SIG.

Tibs used the name "Docutils" for `his effort`__ "to document what the
Python docutils package should support, with a particular emphasis on
documentation strings".  Tibs joined the current project (and its
predecessors) and graciously donated the name.

For more history of reStructuredText and the Docutils project, see `An
Introduction to reStructuredText`_.

Please note that the name is "Docutils", not "DocUtils" or "Doc-Utils"
or any other variation.

reStructuredText
================

What is reStructuredText?
-------------------------

reStructuredText_ is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get
plaintext markup syntax and parser system.  The reStructuredText
parser is a component of Docutils_.  reStructuredText is a revision
and reinterpretation of the StructuredText_ and Setext_ lightweight
markup systems.

If you are reading this on the web, you can see for yourself.  `The
source for this FAQ`__ is written in reStructuredText; open it in
another window and compare them side by side.

Why is it called "reStructuredText"?
------------------------------------

The name came from a combination of "StructuredText", one of
reStructuredText's predecessors, with "re" (as in the ``re.py``
regular expression module), "revised", "reworked", and
"reinterpreted".  For a detailed history of reStructuredText and the
Docutils project, see `An Introduction to reStructuredText`_.


What's the standard abbreviation for "reStructuredText"?
--------------------------------------------------------

"RST" and "ReST" (or "reST") are both acceptable.  Care should be
taken with capitalization, to avoid confusion with "REST__", an
acronym for "Representational State Transfer".

The abbreviations "reSTX" and "rSTX"/"rstx" should **not** be used;
they overemphasize reStructuredText's precedessor, Zope's
StructuredText.

What's the standard filename extension for a reStructuredText file?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's ".txt".  Some people would like to use ".rest" or ".rst" or
".restx", but why bother?  ReStructuredText source files are meant to
be readable as plaintext, and most operating systems already associate
".txt" with text files.  Using a specialized filename extension would
require that users alter their OS settings, which is something that
many users will not be willing or able to do.


How can I indicate the document title?  Subtitle?
-------------------------------------------------

If there's only one highest-level section title at the beginning of a
document, it is treated specially, as the document title.  Similarly,
a lone second-highest-level section title may become the document
subtitle if it immediately follows the document title.

For example::

    This is the Document Title
    ==========================

    This is the Document Subtitle
    -----------------------------

    Here's an ordinary paragraph.

Counterexample::

    Here's an ordinary paragraph.

    This is *not* a Document Title
    ==============================

    The "ordinary paragraph" above the section title
    prevents it from becoming the document title.


HTML Writer
===========

What is the status of the HTML Writer?
--------------------------------------

The HTML Writer module, ``docutils/writers/html4css1.py``, is a
proof-of-concept reference implementation.  While it is a complete
implementation, some aspects of the HTML it produces may be
incompatible with older browsers or specialized applications (such as
web templating).  Alternate implementations are welcome.


What kind of HTML does it produce?
----------------------------------

It produces XHTML compatible with the `HTML 4.01`_ and `XHTML 1.0`_
specifications.  A cascading style sheet ("default.css" by default) is
required for proper viewing with a modern graphical browser.  Correct
rendering of the HTML produced depends on the CSS support of the
browser.

.. _HTML 4.01: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/
.. _XHTML 1.0: http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/


What browsers are supported?
----------------------------

No specific browser is targeted; all modern graphical browsers should
work.  Some older browsers, text-only browsers, and browsers without
full CSS support are known to produce inferior results.  Mozilla
(version 1.0 and up) and MS Internet Explorer (version 5.0 and up) are
known to give good results.  Reports of experiences with other
browsers are welcome.


Unexpected results from tools/html.py: H1, H1 instead of H1, H2.  Why?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the question in full:

    I have this text::

        Heading 1
        =========

        All my life, I wanted to be H1.

        Heading 1.1
        -----------

        But along came H1, and so shouldn't I be H2?
        No!  I'm H1!

        Heading 1.1.1
        *************

        Yeah, imagine me, I'm stuck at H3!  No?!?

    When I run it through tools/html.py, I get unexpected results
    (below).  I was expecting H1, H2, then H3; instead, I get H1, H1,
    H2::

        ...
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
        ...
        <title>Heading 1</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="default.css" type="text/css" />
        </head>
        <body>
        <div class="document" id="heading-1">
        <h1 class="title">Heading 1</h1>                <-- first H1
        <p>All my life, I wanted to be H1.</p>
        <div class="section" id="heading-1-1">
        <h1><a name="heading-1-1">Heading 1.1</a></h1>        <-- H1
        <p>But along came H1, and so now I must be H2.</p>
        <div class="section" id="heading-1-1-1">
        <h2><a name="heading-1-1-1">Heading 1.1.1</a></h2>
        <p>Yeah, imagine me, I'm stuck at H3!</p>
        ...

    What gives? 

Check the "class" attribute on the H1 tags, and you will see a
difference.  The first H1 is actually ``<h1 class="title">``; this is
the document title, and the default stylesheet renders it centered.
There can also be an ``<h2 class="subtitle">`` for the document
subtitle.

If there's only one highest-level section title at the beginning of a
document, it is treated specially, as the document title.  (Similarly,
a lone second-highest-level section title may become the document
subtitle.)  Rather than use a plain H1 for that, we use ``<h1
class="title">`` so that we can use H1 again within the document.  Why
do we do this?  HTML only has H1-H6, so by making H1 do double duty,
we effectively reserve these tags to provide 6 levels of heading
beyond the single document title.

HTML is being used for dumb formatting for nothing but final display.
A stylesheet *is required*, and one is provided:
tools/stylesheets/default.css.  Of course, you're welcome to roll your
own.

(Thanks to Mark McEahern for the question and much of the answer.)


Why do enumerated lists only use numbers (no letters or roman numerals)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rendering of enumerators (the numbers or letters acting as list
markers) is completely governed by the stylesheet, so either the
browser can't find the stylesheet (try using the "--embed-stylesheet"
option), or the browser can't understand it (try a recent Mozilla or
MSIE).
