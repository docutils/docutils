Changes Since 0.1
========================

General:

- The word "component" was being used ambiguously.  From now on,
  "component" will be used to mean "Docutils component", as in Reader,
  Writer, Parser, or Transform.  Portions of documents (Table of
  Contents, sections, etc.)  will be called "document parts".

- Did a grand renaming: a lot of ``verylongnames`` became
  ``very_long_names``.

Specific:

* docutils/__init__.py:

  - Added ``ApplicationError`` and ``DataError``, for use throughout
    the package.
  - Added ``Component`` base class for Docutils components; implements
    the ``supports`` method.

* docutils/nodes.py:

  - Added ``TreeCopyVisitor`` class.
  - Added a ``copy`` method to ``Node`` and subclasses.
  - Added a ``SkipDeparture`` exception for visitors.
  - Renamed ``TreePruningException`` from ``VisitorException``.
  - Added docstrings to ``TreePruningException``, subclasses, and
    ``Nodes.walk()``.

* docutils/statemachine.py:

  - Added ``runtime_init`` method to ``StateMachine`` and ``State``.
  - Added underscores to improve many awkward names.

* docutils/utils.py:

  - Added ``clean_rcs_keywords`` function (moved from
    docutils/transforms/frontmatter.py
    ``DocInfo.filter_rcs_keywords``).
  - Added underscores to improve many awkward names.

* docutils/parsers/rst/states.py:

  - Added underscores to improve many awkward names.
  - Added RFC-2822 header support.
  - Extracted the inline parsing code from ``RSTState`` to a separate
    class, ``Inliner``, which will allow easy subclassing.
  - Made local bindings for ``memo`` container & often-used contents
    (reduces code complexity a lot).  See ``RSTState.runtime_init()``.
  - ``RSTState.parent`` replaces ``RSTState.statemachine.node``.
  - Added ``MarkupMismatch`` exception; for late corrections.

* docutils/parsers/rst/directives/html.py: Changed the ``meta``
  directive to use a ``pending`` element, used only by HTML writers.

* docutils/parsers/rst/directives/parts.py: Renamed from
  components.py.

* docutils/readers/__init__.py: Gave Readers more control over
  choosing and instantiating Parsers.

* docutils/readers/pep.py: Added to project; for PEP processing.

* docutils/transforms/__init__.py: ``Transform.__init__()`` now
  requires a ``component`` parameter.

* docutils/transforms/peps.py: Added to project; PEP-specific.

* docutils/transforms/parts.py: Renamed from old components.py.

  - Added filter for `Contents`, to use alt-text for inline images,
    and to remove inline markup that doesn't make sense in the ToC.

* docutils/transforms/components.py: Added to project; transforms
  related to Docutils components.

* docutils/transforms/universal.py: Changed ``Messages`` transform to
  properly filter out system messages below the warning threshold.

* docutils/writers/__init__.py: Added "pdf" alias in anticipation of
  Engelbert Gruber's PDF writer.

* docutils/writers/html4css1.py:

  - Made XHTML-compatible (switched to lowercase element & attribute
    names; empty tag format).
  - Escape double-dashes in comment text.
  - Improved boilerplate & modularity of output.

* docutils/writers/pseudoxml.py: Renamed from pprint.py.

* spec/notes.txt: Continual updates.  Added "Project Policies".

* spec/pep-0257.txt: Clarified prohibition of signature repetition.

* spec/rst/reStructuredText.txt:

  - Clarified field list usage.
  - Updated enumerated list description.

* spec/rst/alternatives.txt: Expanded auto-enumerated list idea;
  thanks to Fred Bremmer.

* spec/rst/problems.txt: Updated the Enumerated List Markup
  discussion.

* test: Made test modules standalone (subdirectories became packages).

* test/DocutilsTestSupport.py: Support for PEP extensions to
  reStructuredText.

* test/package_unittest.py: Renamed from UnitTestFolder.py.

  - Now supports true packages containing test modules
    (``__init__.py`` files required); fixes duplicate module name bug.

* test/test_pep/: Subpackage added to project; PEP testing.


Release 0.1 (2002-04-20)
========================

This is the first release of Docutils, merged from the now inactive
reStructuredText__ and `Docstring Processing System`__ projects.  For
the pre-Docutils history, see the `reStructuredText HISTORY`__ and the
`DPS HISTORY`__ files.

__ http://structuredtext.sourceforge.net/
__ http://docstring.sourceforge.net/
__ http://structuredtext.sourceforge.net/HISTORY.html
__ http://docstring.sourceforge.net/HISTORY.html

General changes: renamed 'dps' package to 'docutils'; renamed
'restructuredtext' subpackage to 'rst'; merged the codebases; merged
the test suites (reStructuredText's test/test_states renamed to
test/test_rst); and all modifications required to make it all work.

* docutils/parsers/rst/states.py:

  - Improved diagnostic system messages for missing blank lines.
  - Fixed substitution_reference bug.
