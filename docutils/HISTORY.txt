Release 0.2 (2002-07-31)
========================

General:

- The word "component" was being used ambiguously.  From now on,
  "component" will be used to mean "Docutils component", as in Reader,
  Writer, Parser, or Transform.  Portions of documents (Table of
  Contents, sections, etc.)  will be called "document parts".
- Did a grand renaming: a lot of ``verylongnames`` became
  ``very_long_names``.
- Cleaned up imports: no more relative package imports or
  comma-separated lists of top-level modules.
- Added support for an option values object which carries default
  settings and overrides (from command-line options and library use).
- Added internal Unicode support, and support for both input and
  output encodings.
- Added support for the ``docutils.io.IO`` class & subclasses.

Specific:

* docutils/__init__.py:

  - Added ``ApplicationError`` and ``DataError``, for use throughout
    the package.
  - Added ``Component`` base class for Docutils components; implements
    the ``supports`` method.
  - Added ``__version__`` (thus, ``docutils.__version__``).

* docutils/core.py:

  - Removed many keyword parameters to ``Publisher.__init__()`` and
    ``publish()``; bundled into an option values object.  Added
    "argv", "usage", "description", and "option_spec" parameters for
    command-line support.
  - Added ``Publisher.process_command_line()`` and ``.set_options()``
    methods.
  - Reworked I/O model for ``docutils.io`` wrappers.
  - Updated ``Publisher.set_options()``; now returns option values
    object.
  - Added support for configuration files (/etc/docutils.conf,
    ./docutils.conf, ~/.docutils).
  - Added ``Publisher.setup_option_parser()``.
  - Added default usage message and description.

* docutils/frontend.py: Added to project; support for front-end
  (command-line) scripts.  Option specifications may be augmented by
  components.  Requires Optik (http://optik.sf.net/) for option
  processing (installed locally as docutils/optik.py).

* docutils/io.py: Added to project; uniform API for a variety of input
  output mechanisms.

* docutils/nodes.py:

  - Added ``TreeCopyVisitor`` class.
  - Added a ``copy`` method to ``Node`` and subclasses.
  - Added a ``SkipDeparture`` exception for visitors.
  - Renamed ``TreePruningException`` from ``VisitorException``.

    ``Nodes.walk()``.
  - Improved docstrings.
  - Added ``SparseNodeVisitor``, refined ``NodeVisitor``.
  - Moved ``utils.id()`` to ``nodes.make_id()`` to avoid circular
    imports.
  - Added ``decoration``, ``header``, and ``footer`` node classes, and
    ``PreDecorative`` mixin.
  - Reworked the name/id bookkeeping; to ``document``, removed
    ``explicit_targets`` and ``implicit_targets`` attributes, added
    ``nametypes`` attribute and ``set_name_id_map`` method.
  - Added ``NodeFound`` exception, for use with ``NodeVisitor``
    traversals.
  - Added ``document.has_name()`` method.
  - Fixed DOM generation for list-attributes.
  - Added category class ``Labeled`` (used by footnotes & citations).
  - Added ``Element.set_class()`` method (sets "class" attribute).

* docutils/optik.py: Added to project.  Combined from the Optik
  package, with added option groups and other modifications.  The use
  of this module is probably only temporary.

* docutils/statemachine.py:

  - Added ``runtime_init`` method to ``StateMachine`` and ``State``.
  - Added underscores to improve many awkward names.
  - In ``string2lines()``, changed whitespace normalizing translation
    table to regexp; restores Python 2.0 compatibility with Unicode.

* docutils/urischemes.py:

  - Filled in some descriptions.
  - Added "shttp" scheme.

* docutils/utils.py:

    warning_level -> report_level; error_level -> halt_level.

    (reduces code complexity a lot).  See ``RSTState.runtime_init()``.
  - ``RSTState.parent`` replaces ``RSTState.statemachine.node``.
  - Added ``MarkupMismatch`` exception; for late corrections.
  - Added ``-/:`` characters to inline markup's start string prefix,
    ``/`` to end string suffix.
  - Fixed a footnote bug.
  - Fixed a bug with literal blocks.
  - Applied patch from Simon Budig: simplified regexps with symbolic
