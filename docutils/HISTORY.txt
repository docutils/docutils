Changes Since 0.2
========================

General:

* Renamed "attribute" to "option" for directives/extensions.

* Renamed transform method "transform" to "apply".

* Renamed "options" to "settings" for runtime settings (as set by
  command-line options).  Sometimes "option" (singular) became
  "settings" (plural).  Some variations below:

  - document.options -> document.settings (stored in other objects as
    well)
  - option_spec -> settings_spec (not directives though)
  - OptionSpec -> SettingsSpec
  - cmdline_options -> settings_spec
  - relative_path_options -> relative_path_settings
  - option_default_overrides -> settings_default_overrides
  - Publisher.set_options -> Publisher.get_settings

Specific:

* FAQ.txt: Frequently asked questions, added to project.

* docutils/__init__.py:

  - Bumped version to 0.2.1 to reflect changes to I/O classes.
  - Bumped version to 0.2.2 to reflect changes to stylesheet options.
  - Factored ``SettingsSpec`` out of ``Component``; separately useful.
  - Bumped version to 0.2.3 because of the new "--embed-stylesheet"
    option and its effect on the PEP template & writer.
  - Bumped version to 0.2.4 due to changes to the PEP template &
    stylesheet.
  - Bumped version to 0.2.5 to reflect changes to Reporter output.
  - Added ``TransformSpec`` class for new transform system.
  - Bumped version to 0.2.6 for API changes (renaming).
  - Bumped version to 0.2.7 for new ``docutils.core.publish_*``
    convenience functions.
  - Added ``Component.component_type`` attribute.
  - Bumped version to 0.2.8 because of the internal parser switch from
    plain lists to the docutils.statemachine.StringList objects.

* docutils/core.py:

  - Made ``publish()`` a bit more convenient.
  - Generalized ``Publisher.set_io``.
  - Renamed ``publish()`` to ``publish_cmdline()``; rearranged its
    parameters; improved its docstring.

    ``OptionParser.populate_from_components()`` to combine it all.
  - Require list of keys in ``make_paths_absolute`` (was implicit in
    global ``relative_path_settings``).
  - Added "--expose-internal-attribute", "--dump-pseudo-xml",
    "--dump-settings", and "--dump-transforms" hidden options.

  - Factored out ``State.add_initial_transitions()`` so it can be
    extended.

    from special-case code to ordinary transitions: removed

Release 0.2 (2002-07-31)
========================

General:

- The word "component" was being used ambiguously.  From now on,
  "component" will be used to mean "Docutils component", as in Reader,
  Writer, Parser, or Transform.  Portions of documents (Table of
  Contents, sections, etc.)  will be called "document parts".
- Did a grand renaming: a lot of ``verylongnames`` became
  ``very_long_names``.
- Cleaned up imports: no more relative package imports or
  comma-separated lists of top-level modules.
- Added support for an option values object which carries default
  settings and overrides (from command-line options and library use).
- Added internal Unicode support, and support for both input and
  output encodings.
- Added support for the ``docutils.io.IO`` class & subclasses.

Specific:

* docutils/__init__.py:

  - Added ``ApplicationError`` and ``DataError``, for use throughout
    the package.
  - Added ``Component`` base class for Docutils components; implements
    the ``supports`` method.
  - Added ``__version__`` (thus, ``docutils.__version__``).

* docutils/core.py:

  - Removed many keyword parameters to ``Publisher.__init__()`` and
    ``publish()``; bundled into an option values object.  Added
    "argv", "usage", "description", and "option_spec" parameters for
    command-line support.
  - Added ``Publisher.process_command_line()`` and ``.set_options()``
    methods.
  - Reworked I/O model for ``docutils.io`` wrappers.
  - Updated ``Publisher.set_options()``; now returns option values
    object.
  - Added support for configuration files (/etc/docutils.conf,
    ./docutils.conf, ~/.docutils).
  - Added ``Publisher.setup_option_parser()``.
  - Added default usage message and description.

* docutils/frontend.py: Added to project; support for front-end
  (command-line) scripts.  Option specifications may be augmented by
  components.  Requires Optik (http://optik.sf.net/) for option
  processing (installed locally as docutils/optik.py).

* docutils/io.py: Added to project; uniform API for a variety of input
  output mechanisms.

* docutils/nodes.py:

  - Added ``TreeCopyVisitor`` class.
  - Added a ``copy`` method to ``Node`` and subclasses.
  - Added a ``SkipDeparture`` exception for visitors.
  - Renamed ``TreePruningException`` from ``VisitorException``.

  - Added ``SparseNodeVisitor``, refined ``NodeVisitor``.
  - Moved ``utils.id()`` to ``nodes.make_id()`` to avoid circular
    imports.
  - Added ``decoration``, ``header``, and ``footer`` node classes, and
    ``PreDecorative`` mixin.
  - Reworked the name/id bookkeeping; to ``document``, removed
    ``explicit_targets`` and ``implicit_targets`` attributes, added
    ``nametypes`` attribute and ``set_name_id_map`` method.
  - Added ``NodeFound`` exception, for use with ``NodeVisitor``
    traversals.
  - Added ``document.has_name()`` method.
  - Fixed DOM generation for list-attributes.
  - Added category class ``Labeled`` (used by footnotes & citations).
