Changes to the `html4css1` Writer
=================================

* Use only meta_ keywords recognized by HTML 5.
  Add HTML5-compatible meta tags for docinfo items
  "authors", "date", and "copyright".

  Add a `viewport meta tag`__ to tell mobile browsers
  to use the device-width as viewport.

  __ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag

* Set table column widths with <style="width: ...">, not "width" argument.

* Horizontal alignment of table heads with CSS.

* Do not drop paragraph objects, use CSS rules to prevent unwanted vertical
  space.

* Put subtitles in <p> elements.

* Use the new semantic tags <main>, <section>, <header>,
  <footer>, <aside>, <figure>, and <figcaption>.
  See ``minimal.css`` and ``responsive.css`` for styling rule examples.

  Change the `initial_header_level` setting default to "2", as browsers
  use the `same style for <h1> and <h2> when nested in a <section\>`__.

  __ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39547412/same-font-size-for-h1-and-h2-in-article

* Use HTML5 tags <small>, <s>, <q>, <dfn>, <var>, <samp>, <kbd>,
  <i>, <b>, <u>, <mark>, and <bdi> if a matching class value
  is found in `inline` and `literal` elements.
  Use <ins> and <del> if a matching class value
  is found in `inline`, `literal`, or `container` elements.
  (See `text-level semantics`_ and `indicating edits`_.)

Field List Rendering
--------------------

A `field list` is converted to a HTML `definition list` and given the
``field-list`` class argument value to allow CSS styling.
With ``html_plain.css``, the layout is similar to `html4css1`:

.. class:: open

:A long field name: sticks into the field body.

    The field body is pushed to the next line (you can suppress this
    behaviour with the `run-in`_ class argument).

:Customization: of the field name width is possible with CSS instead
    of the `field-name-limit` configuration setting, for
    example::

      dl.field-list > dd { margin-left: 6em; }

:Empty:

:fields:  must not lead to misalignment of the following content.

Styling with Class Arguments
----------------------------

The ``plain.css`` style sheet comes with some pre-defined style variants
that can be choosen via a class argument.

Description Lists
`````````````````

Definition lists with the "description" class argument:

.. class:: description

description lists
    Definition lists that are styled like in most dictionaries,
    encyclopedias etc. (as well as the LaTeX `description` environment).
label
    The term to be described. Put in boldface or italic.
Content
    starts on the same line and has a hanging indent.
A label without content
    ..
and the next label
    must align.

as well
    as content containing more than one

    paragraph

or
    * nested lists
    * item 2
or
    nested
      definition lists


Field List Variants
```````````````````

For field lists, the "compact/open", "narrow" and "run-in" styles are defined
in the style sheet ``plain.css``.

*compact*
  .. class:: compact

  :Feature: No additional space between list items.

  :Option: The ``--compact-field-lists`` command line option (and the
           corresponding configuration setting) set the `compact`
           class argument on all "simple" field lists, if not
           overridden with `open`.

  :Use:  For lists with short field body.

*open*
  .. class:: open

  :Feature: Additional space between list items also in "simple" lists.
            (Overrides the ``--compact-field-lists`` command line
            option and the corresponding configuration setting)

  :Use: For "simple" lists that should keep the space between list items.

*narrow*
  .. class:: narrow

  :Feature: Less indented field body.
  :Use:   For lists with short field names.
  :A long field name:
       sticks into the field body and the field body starts on a
       new line (if not combined with `run-in`_).

.. _`run-in`:

*run-in*
  .. class:: run-in

  :Feature: Field body starts on the same line also after long field
            names.

  :A long field name: sticks into the field body which continues on
                         the same line.

  :The next field name:  and field body should align. Long text in the field
                         body is wrapped and aligns with other fields.

Table Variants
``````````````

The following styles can be applied to individual tables via a class
argument or as document wide setting with the table-style_ configuration
setting (or command line argument).

* Numbered tables can be achieved with the "numbered" class option:

  .. table:: truth values
     :class: numbered

     ======= ======= ==========
     A       B       A or B
     ======= ======= ==========
     False   False   False
     True    False   True
     False   True    True
     True    True    True
     ======= ======= ==========

  Currently, referencing to the table by number is not supported. This is a
  common request and already on the `TODO list`.

* A table with "booktabs" class value, is rendered similar to the style
  from the booktabs_ LaTeX package.

  .. _table-style:
     http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/config.html#table-style
  .. _booktabs:
     http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/booktabs.pdf

"Booktabs" style table, numbered, centre-aligned, with auto-sized columns:

  .. table:: I/O values
     :class: booktabs numbered
     :align: center
     :widths: auto

     ======= ======= ==========
     Input           Output
     --------------- ----------
     A       B       A or B
     ======= ======= ==========
     False   False   False
     True    False   True
     False   True    True
     True    True    True
     ======= ======= ==========

Numbered Figures
````````````````

Numbered figures can be achieved with the "numbered" ``:figclass:`` option:

.. figure:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/title.svg
   :alt: reStructuredText, the markup syntax
   :figclass: numbered
   :width: 100%

   SVG image in a numbered figure.
