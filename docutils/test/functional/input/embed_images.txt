Embedded Images
---------------

The "embed" flag tells Docutils that it should 
try to embed the image in the output document.

If the image can be read from the local file system, it is base64_
encoded and included as a `data URI`_. 
In future, SVG images may be directly inserted into HTML5.

   .. figure:: ../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.svg
      :alt: biohazard
      :align: center
   
      SVG image embedded in a figure.


Embedded inline image |inline-embedded| scaled to a height of 0.8 em.

  .. |inline-embedded| image:: ../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
     :height: 0.8 em
