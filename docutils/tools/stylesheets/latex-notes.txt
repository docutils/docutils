    3.1.6. How can I make a document portable to both latex and pdflatex
    Contributed by: Christian Kumpf
    Check for the existence of the variable \pdfoutput:
    \newif\ifpdf
    \ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
    \pdffalse % we are not running PDFLaTeX
    \else
    \pdfoutput=1 % we are running PDFLaTeX
    \pdftrue
    \fi
    Then use your new variable \ifpdf
    \ifpdf
    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
    \pdfcompresslevel=9
    \else
    \usepackage{graphicx}
    \fi

Width of images needs cleanup, in the framework.  Integers aren't
sufficient (virtually unusable in typeset documents).  Need to discuss
on Docutils-develop and come up with a set of standard units.
