  [2009/03/26 v0.1 compatibility with rst2latex from Docutils 0.5]

This file documents changes and provides a style for best possible
compatibility to the behaviour of the `latex2e` writer of Doctutils
release 0.5

.. contents::
   :depth: 3

Usage
=====

* To get an (almost) identic look for your old documents without further
  configuration, place ``docutils-05-compat.sty`` in the TEXINPUT path (e.g.
  the current work directory) and pass the
  ``--stylesheet=docutils-05-compat`` option to ``rst2latex.py``.

* To use your custom stylesheets without change, add them to the
  compatibility style, e.g.
  ``--stylesheet="docutils-05-compat,mystyle.tex``.

.. tip:: As the changes include bug fixes that are partly reverted by this
   style, it is recommended to adapt the stylesheets to the new version or
   copy just the relevant parts of this style into them.

Changes since 0.5
=================

LaTeX style sheets
------------------

New Feature:
  LaTeX packages can be used as ``--stylesheet`` argument without
  restriction.

Implementation:
  Use ``\usepackage`` if style sheet ends with ``.sty`` or has no
  extension and ``\input`` else.

Rationale:
  while ``\input`` works with extension as well as without extension,
  ``\usepackage`` expects the package name without extension. (The latex2e
  writer will strip a ``.sty`` extension.)


Backwards compatibility:
  Up to Docutils 0.5, if no filename extension is given in the
  ``stylesheet`` argument, ``.tex`` is assumed (by latex).

  Since Docutils 0.6, a stylesheet without filename extension is assumed to
  be a LaTeX package (``*.sty``) and referenced with the ``\usepackage``
  command.

.. tip::
  Always specify the extension if you want the style sheet to be
  ``\input`` by LaTeX.


Custom roles
------------

New Feature: failsave implementation
 As with classes to HTML objects, class arguments are silently ignored if
 there is no styling rule for this class in a custom style sheet.

New Feature: custom roles based on standard roles
 As class support needs to be handled by the LaTeX writer, this feature was
 not present "automatically" (as in HTML). Modified visit/depart_*() methods
 for the standard roles now call visit/depart_inline() if there are class
 arguments to the node.

Backwards compatibility:
  SVN versions 5742 to 5861 contained an implementation that did not work
  with commands expecting an argument. The implementation from version 5862
  is fully backwards compatible.


Length units
------------

New Features:
  #. add default unit if none given (to prevent LaTeX error)
     a poll on docutils-users favoured ``bp`` (Big Point: 1 bp  = 1/72 in)

  #. Do not change ``px`` to ``pt``.

Rationale:
  * ``px`` is a valid unit in pdftex since version 1.3.0 released on
    2005-02-04:

     1px defaults to 1bp (or 72dpi), but can be changed with the \pdfpxdimen
     primitive::

       \pdfpxdimen=1in % 1 dpi
       \divide\pdfpxdimen by 96 % 96 dpi

     --  http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/NEWS

  * Modern TeX distributions use pdftex also for dvi generation
    (i.e. ``latex`` actually calls ``pdftex`` with some options).

Backwards compatibility:
  Images with width specification in ``px`` come out slightly (0.3 %) larger:

    1 px = 1 bp  = 1/72 in > 1 pt = 1/72.25 in

  This can be reset with ::

    \pdfpxdimen=1pt

.. caution:: It is impossible to revert the change of lengths specified
   without unit in a style sheet, however the 0.3 % change will be
   imperceptible in most cases.

Error ``illegal unit px``:
  The unit ``px`` is not defined in "pure" LaTeX, but introduced by the
  `pdfTeX` converter on 2005-02-04. `pdfTeX` is used in all modern LaTeX
  distributions (since ca. 2006) also for conversion into DVI.

  If you convert the LaTeX source with a legacy program, you might get the
  error ``illegal unit px``.

.. tip::
  If updating LaTeX is not an option, just remove the ``px`` from the length
  specification. HTML/CSS will default to ``px`` while the `latexe2` writer
  will add the fallback unit ``bp``.


Font encoding
-------------

New feature:
  Do not mix font-encoding and font settings: do not load `ae` and `aeguill`
  unless explicitely required via the ``--stylesheet`` option.

  :font-encoding = "":  do not load `ae` and `aeguill` packages, i.e.

                        * do not change font settings,
                        * do not use the fontenc package
                          (implicitely loaded via `ae`),
                        * use LaTeX default font encoding (OT1)

  :font-encoding = "OT1": load `fontenc` with ``\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}``

Example:
  ``--font-encoding=LGR,T1`` becomes ``\usepackage[LGR,T1]{fontenc}``
  (Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, and Greek)


Backwards compatibility:
  Load the ae and aeguill packages if fontenc is not used::

    \@ifundefined{@ifl@ter@@}
      {\RequirePackage{ae,aeguill}}
      {}

.. Why not ``\@ifpackageloaded{fontenc}``?

   'fontenc' disables the test to enable loading more than once with
   different options. ``\@ifl@ter@@`` seems to be the only control sequence
   that survives

.. tip:: Using `ae` is not recommended. A similar look (but better
   implementation) can be achieved with the packages `lmodern`, `cmsuper`,
   or `cmlgr` all providing Computer Modern look-alikes in vector format and
   T1 encoding, e.g. ``--font-encoding=T1 --stylesheet=lmodern``.

Sub- and superscript as text
----------------------------

New feature:
  Set sub- and superscript role argument in text mode not as math.

  Wraps the role argument in ``$_{\mbox{\scriptsize <subscript text>}}$``
  or ``$^{\mbox{\scriptsize <superscript text>}}$``.

Backwards compatibility:
  **None**

  In math mode, Latin letters are typeset italic and whitespace is ignored.

.. tip:: To get italic subscripts, define and use in your document custom
   roles like ``.. role:: sub(subscript)`` and ``.. role::
   super(superscript)`` and define the "role commands"::

     \newcommand{\docutilsrolesub}{\itshape}
     \newcommand{\docutilsrolesuper}{\itshape}

   This is not fully backwards compatible, as it will also set numbers in
   italic shape and not ignore whitespace. However, switching to math-mode
   is insecure with some characters like '$'.

Page layout
-----------

New features:
  * Margins are configurable via the ``DIV=...`` document option.

  * It is possible to disable the use of the `typearea` package by not
    including the ``DIV`` setting in the ``--documentoptions``.

  * The ``\raggedbottom`` setting is no longer inserted into the document. It
    is the default for article and report classes. If requested in combination
    with a book class, it can be given in a custom style sheet.

Backwards compatibility:
  Up to version 0.5, use of `typearea` and a DIV setting of 12 were
  hard-coded into the latex2e writer ::

    \usepackage{typearea}
    \typearea{12}

  and the vertical alignment of lower boundary of the text area in book
  classes disabled via ::

    \raggedbottom

Shorter preamble
----------------

New feature:
  The document preamble is pruned to contain only relevant commands and
  settings.

Packages that are no longer required
````````````````````````````````````

The following packages where required in pre-0.5 versions and still loaded
with version 0.5::

  \usepackage{shortvrb}
  \usepackage{amsmath}

Packages that are conditionally loaded
``````````````````````````````````````

Additional to the `typearea` for `page layout`_, the following packages are
only loaded if actually required by doctree elements:

Tables
^^^^^^

Standard package for tables across several pages::

  \usepackage{longtable}

Extra space between text in tables and the line above them
('array' is implicitely loaded by 'tabularx', see below)::

  \usepackage{array}
  \setlength{\extrarowheight}{2pt}

Table cells spanning multiple rows::

  \usepackage{multirow}

Docinfo
^^^^^^^

Tables with automatic width of columns, always on one page::

  \usepackage{tabularx}

Images
^^^^^^
::

  \usepackage{graphicx}

Problematic, Sidebar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Set text and/or background colour, provide ``\colorbox``::

  \usepackage{color}

Floats for footnotes settings
`````````````````````````````

Settings for the use of floats for footnotes are only included if

* the option "use-latex-footnotes" is False, and
* there is at least one footnote in the document.

::

  % begin: floats for footnotes tweaking.
  \setlength{\floatsep}{0.5em}
  \setlength{\textfloatsep}{\fill}
  \addtolength{\textfloatsep}{3em}
  \renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.5}
  \renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.5}
  \renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.5}
  \setcounter{totalnumber}{50}
  \setcounter{topnumber}{50}
  \setcounter{bottomnumber}{50}
  % end floats for footnotes


Special lengths, commands, and environments
-------------------------------------------

Renamed definitions (now conditional)
`````````````````````````````````````

The names for special doctree elements are now prefixed with ``DU``.

Up to version 0.5, all definitions were included in the preamble (before the
style sheet) of every document -- even if not used in the body. Since
version 0.6, fallback definitions are included after the style sheet and
only if required.

Customization is done by an alternative definition in a style sheet with
``\newcommand`` instead of the former ``\renewcommand``.

The following code provides the old definitions and maps them (or their
custom variants) to the new interface.

admonition width
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``admonitionwith`` lenght is replaced by the more powerful
``\DUadmonition`` (see `New Definitions`_)::

  \newlength{\admonitionwidth}
  \setlength{\admonitionwidth}{0.9\textwidth}

docinfo width
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

  \newlength{\docinfowidth}
  \setlength{\docinfowidth}{0.9\textwidth}

  \newlength{\DUdocinfowidth}
  \AtBeginDocument{\setlength{\DUdocinfowidth}{\docinfowidth}}

line block
^^^^^^^^^^
::

  \newlength{\lineblockindentation}
  \setlength{\lineblockindentation}{2.5em}
  \newenvironment{lineblock}[1]
  {\begin{list}{}
    {\setlength{\partopsep}{\parskip}
     \addtolength{\partopsep}{\baselineskip}
     \topsep0pt\itemsep0.15\baselineskip\parsep0pt
     \leftmargin#1}
   \raggedright}
  {\end{list}}

  \newlength{\DUlineblockindent}
  \AtBeginDocument{\setlength{\DUlineblockindent}{\lineblockindentation}}
  \newenvironment{DUlineblock}[1]
    {\begin{lineblock}{#1}}
    {\end{lineblock}}

local line width
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``\locallinewidth`` length for internal use in tables is replaced
by ``\DUtablewidth``. It was never intended for customization::

  \newlength{\locallinewidth}

option lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

  \newcommand{\optionlistlabel}[1]{\bf #1 \hfill}
  \newenvironment{optionlist}[1]
  {\begin{list}{}
    {\setlength{\labelwidth}{#1}
     \setlength{\rightmargin}{1cm}
     \setlength{\leftmargin}{\rightmargin}
     \addtolength{\leftmargin}{\labelwidth}
     \addtolength{\leftmargin}{\labelsep}
     \renewcommand{\makelabel}{\optionlistlabel}}
  }{\end{list}}

  \newcommand{\DUoptionlistlabel}{\optionlistlabel}
  \newenvironment{DUoptionlist}
    {\begin{optionlist}{3cm}}
    {\end{optionlist}}

rubric
^^^^^^
::

  \newcommand{\rubric}[1]{\subsection*{~\hfill {\it #1} \hfill ~}}

  \newcommand{\DUrubric}[1]{\rubric{#1}}

title reference role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

  \newcommand{\titlereference}[1]{\textsl{#1}}

  \newcommand{\DUroletitlereference}[1]{\titlereference{#1}}


New definitions
```````````````

New Feature:
  Enable customization of some more Docutils elements with special commands

  :sidebar:    ``DUsidebar`` command (better environment?)
  :transition: ``\DUtransition`` command
  :admonition: ``DUadmonition`` environment (replacing ``\admonitionwidth``
  :field list: ``DUfieldlist`` environment

Backwards compatibility:
  In most cases, the default definition corresponds to the previously used
  construct. The following definitions restore the old behaviour in case of
  changes.

  Admonitions: (use the ``\admonitionwidth`` variable)::

    \newcommand{\DUadmonition}[1]{%
      \begin{center}
        \fbox{\parbox{\admonitionwidth}{\sffamily #1}}
      \end{center}
