 Docutils Front-End Tools

==========================

Once the Docutils package is unpacked, you will discover a "``tools``"

directory containing several front ends for common Docutils

processing.  Most front ends combine a Docutils "Reader" (which knows

how to interpret a file in context) with a "Writer" (which knows how

to generate a specific data format)



Each tool has a "``--help``" option which lists the `command-line

options`_ and arguments it supports.  Processing can also be

customized with `configuration files`_.





.. contents::





html.py

=======



:Reader: Standalone

:Parser: reStructuredText

:Writer: HTML



The ``html.py`` front end reads standalone reStructuredText source

files and produces HTML 4 (XHTML 1) output.  It inserts a link to a

cascading stylesheet (``.css`` file), ``default.css`` unless specified

by a "--stylesheet" command-line option or in a configuration file.

The ``tools/default.css`` stylesheet is provided for basic use.





pep.py

======



:Reader: PEP

:Parser: reStructuredText

:Writer: PEP/HTML



``pep.py`` reads a new-style PEP (marked up with reStructuredText) and

produces HTML.  It requires a template file and a stylesheet.  By

default, it makes use of a ``pep-html-template`` file and a

``default.css`` stylesheet in the current directory, but these can be

overridden by command-line options or configuration files.  The

``tools/stylesheets/pep.css`` stylesheet is intended specifically for

PEP use.



The ``docutils.conf`` `configuration file`_ in the "``spec``"

directory of Docutils contains a default setup for use in processing

the PEP files there (``spec/pep-*.txt``) into HTML.  It specifies

defaults of ``tools/pep-html-template`` and

``tools/stylesheets/pep.css``.





pep2html.py

===========



:Reader: PEP

:Parser: reStructuredText

:Writer: PEP/HTML



``pep2html.py`` is a modified version of the original script by

Fredrik Lundh, with support for Docutils added.  It reads the

beginning of a PEP text file to determine the format (old-style

indented or new-style reStructuredText) and processes accordingly.

Since it does not use the Docutils front end mechanism (the common

command-line options are not supported), it must be configured using

`configuration files`_.





docutils-xml.py

===============



:Reader: Standalone

:Parser: reStructuredText

:Writer: XML (Docutils native)



The ``docutils-xml.py`` front end produces Docutils-native XML output.

This can be transformed with standard XML tools such as XSLT

processors into arbitrary final forms.





publish.py

==========



:Reader: Standalone

:Parser: reStructuredText

:Writer: Pseudo-XML



``publish.py`` is used for debugging the Docutils Reader -> Transform

-> Writer pipeline.  It produces a compact pretty-printed

"pseudo-XML", where nesting is indicated by indentation (no end-tags).

External attributes for all elements are output, and internal

attributes for any leftover "pending" elements are also given.





quicktest.py

============



:Reader: N/A

:Parser: reStructuredText

:Writer: N/A



The ``quicktest.py`` tool is used for testing the reStructuredText

parser.  It does not use the Docutils Reader/Writer mechanism.

Rather, it does its own I/O and calls the parser directly.  No

transforms are applied to the parsed document.  Various forms output

are possible:



- Pretty-printed pseudo-XML

- Test data (Python list of input and pseudo-XML output strings;

  useful for creating new test cases)

- Pretty-printed native XML

- Raw native XML (with or without a stylesheet reference)





Customization

=============



Command-Line Options

--------------------



Each front-end tool supports command-line options for one-off

customization.  For persistent customization, use `configuration

files`_.



Use the "--help" option on each of the front ends to list the

command-line options it supports.  Command-line options and their

corresponding configuration file entry names are listed in

`Configuration File Entries`_ below.





.. _configuration file:



Configuration Files

-------------------



Configuration files are used for persistent customization; they can be

set once and take effect every time you use a front-end tool.



By default, Docutils checks three places for configuration files, in

the following order:



1. ``/etc/docutils.conf``: This is a system-wide configuration file,

   applicable to all Docutils processing on the system.



2. ``./docutils.conf``: This is a project-specific configuration file,

   located in the current directory.  The Docutils front end has to be

   executed from the directory containing this configuration file for

   it to take effect.  The project-specific configuration file

   overrides the system-wide file.



3. ``~/.docutils``: This is a user-specific configuration file,

   located in the user's home directory.  This file overrides both the

   system-wide and project-specific configuration files.



If more than one configuration file is found, all will be read but

later entries will override earlier ones.  For example, a "stylesheet"

entry in a user-specific configuration file will override a

system-wide entry.



Configuration files use the standard ConfigParser.py_ Python_ module.

From its documentation:



    The configuration file consists of sections, lead by a "[section]"

    header and followed by "name: value" entries, with continuations

    in the style of `RFC 822`_; "name=value" is also accepted.  Note

    that leading whitespace is removed from values.  The optional

    values can contain format strings which refer to other values in

    the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section.

    Additional defaults can be provided upon initialization and

    retrieval.  Lines beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be

    used to provide comments.



Docutils only uses an "[options]" section; all other sections will be

ignored.



Configuration entry names correspond to internal option attributes.

Underscores ("_") and hyphens ("-") can be used interchangably in

entry names.  The correspondence between entry names and command-line

options is listed in `Configuration File Entries`_ below.

Configuration File Entries

--------------------------



The entry names listed below may be specified in `configuration

files`_ (hyphens may be used in place of underscores).  Some knowledge

of Python_ is assumed for some attributes.
