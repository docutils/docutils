Introduction
============

Producing latex code from reST input could be done in at least two ways:

a. Transform the internal markup into corresponding latex markup e.g.
   a section title would be written as ```\section{this section ...}``.
b. Using latex as a typesetting system to produce desired paperwork
   without caring about loosing document structure information.

The former might be preferable, but limits to latexs capabilities, so 
in reality it is a mix.


Options
=======

Configuration can be done in two ways (again):

1. Options to the docutils tool: e.g. language selection.
2. Options to latex via the stylesheet file.

The generated latex documents should be kept processable by a standard
latex installation (if such a thing exists), therefore the document
contains default settings. To allow *overwriting defaults* the stylesheet
is included at last.

Table of contents
-----------------

To get pagenumbers in the table of contents the table of contents must
be generated by latex: ``--use-latex-toc=1``. Usually latex must be run twice to
get numbers correct.

Missing options
---------------

* Selection of latex documentclass and papersize.
* Assumed reST linelength for table width setting.

Problems
========

Open to be fixed or open to discussion.

Tables
------

:Tablewidth: reST-documents line length is assumed to be 80 characters. The
             tablewidth is set relative to this value. If someone produces
             documents with line length of 132 this will fail.


* In tools.txt the option tables right column, there should be some more spacing
  between the description and the next paragraph "Default:".

  Paragraph separation in tables is hairy. 
  see http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=struttab

  - The strut solution did not work.
  - setting extrarowheight added ad top of row not between paragraphs in
    a cell. ALTHOUGH i set it to 2pt because, text is too close to the topline.
  - baselineskip/stretch does not help.
* Should there be two hlines after table head and on table end ?
* Table: multicol cells are always {l}.
* Table heads and footer for longtable (firstpage lastpage ..).
* Longtable does not work with multirow
* Tabularx says "do not use any multicolmn which spans any X column.
  maybe use ltxtable instead of tabularx (Longtable combined with tabularx).
  but ltxtable disables longtable's multicolumn.
* Table cells with multirow and multicolumn
* Tables have borders, and the border is missing in empty cells.


Miscellaneous
-------------

* Doctest blocks is incorrect (python prompt is escaped inside verbatim).
* Support embed-stylesheet.
* the ^-sign is problematic: using mathmode wedge is usually the wrong font.
* Sidebar handling.
* Maybe add end of line after term in definition list. see
    http://roundup.sf.net/doc-0.5/features.pdf
* Pdfbookmark level 4 (and greater) does not work (might be settable but OTOH).
* center subsection{Abstract} gives a latex error here.
  ``! LaTeX Error: Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item.``
  Committed a HACK: centering by hfill.
* Document errors are also too silent.
* Use optionlist for docinfo, the table does only work for single page.
* Consider peter funk's hooks for TeXpert:
  
  * Define his own document preamble (including the choice to
    choose his own documentclass.  That would make the ``--documentclass``
    option superfluous).  I suggest to call this option ``--preamble``
  * Use two additional hooks to put additional stuff just behind the 
    ``\begin{document}`` and just before the ``\end{document}`` macros.
    Typical uses would be ``\tableofcontents``, ``\listoffigures`` and
    ``\appendix``, ``\makeindex``, ``\makeglossary`` and some such 
    for larger documents.

* Hyphens: co-developers should be co--developers ?
* The indentional problematic error in test.txt is not referring anywhere.
* Footnotes are not all on the same page (as in tools/test.txt) and do not link back
  and forth.
* No link to system errors.	
* Hyperlinks are not hyphenated this leads to bad spacing. see tools/test.txt 
  2.14 directives directives
* Meta keywords into pdf ?
* Pagestyle headings does not work, when sections are starred.
* For additional docinfo items: the field_body is inserted as text, i.e. no
  markup is done.
* Multiple author entries in docinfo (same thing as in html).
