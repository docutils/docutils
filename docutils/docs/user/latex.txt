Introduction
============

Producing LaTeX code from reST input can be done in at least two ways:

treat LaTeX as a document format (like HTML):
   Transform the internal markup into corresponding LaTeX markup.
   For example, a section title would be written with the LaTeX section
   command: ``\section{this section title}``.

   This keeps the document structure and semantic markup produing a readable
   LaTeX file, but may require hacking around bugs/features in LaTeX.

   If you prefer this approach, try ``rst2latex.py``.

treat LaTeX as a page description format (like Postscript):
   Use LaTeX as a typesetting system to produce the desired output
   without bothering with the usual LaTeX idioms for representing
   document structure information.
   This will work around Docutils-incompatible features and bugs in LaTeX
   but it produces a hard to read LaTeX file.

   ``rst2newlatex.py`` adds a lot of LaTeX macros and uses LaTeX as a
   typesetter without caring about producing readable LaTeX files.

This documents describes the `latex2e` writer called by the front end
``rst2latex.py``.

PDF generation
==============

In many cases, LaTeX code is not the desired end-format of the document.
LaTeX offers four ways to generate PDF documents from the LaTeX source:

pdflatex
  Generates a PDF document directly from the LaTeX file. As always one
  might need to call it twice (thrice) to get internal references correct.

latex dvipdfm
  Use ``latex`` to generate a DVI file and ``dvipdfm`` to produce a PDF
  file. If you will take this approach, add ``dvipdfm`` to the
  ``--documentoptions``.

latex dvips ps2pdf
  Produce a DVI file with ``latex``, postscript with ``dvips`` and PDF with
  ``ps2pdf``.

xetex
  The `XeTeX`_ engine works with input files in UTF-8 encoding and system
  fonts. It is currently not supported by Docutils.

The Rubber_ wrapper for LaTeX and friends can be used to automatically run
all programs the required number of times and delete "spurious" files.

.. _Rubber: http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~beffara/soft/rubber/


Configuration
=============

Configuration can be done via configuration options_ to the Docutils tool,
`custom style sheets`_ and LaTeX packages, as well as `raw LaTeX`_ in the
document.

Options
-------

The LaTeX code generation can be configured via options to the Docutils
latex writer given as

command-line options
  to the conversion command (run ``rst2latex.py --help`` to get a list of
  available options), or

configuration settings
  in a configuration file (see `Docutils Configuration`_ for details).

.. _Docutils Configuration:
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/config.html


Custom style sheets
-------------------

LaTeX style sheets can be used to configure the look of the printout/PDF by
(re-)defining LaTeX-commands and settings.

The option::

  --stylesheet=STYLESHEET

references STYLESHEET using the command ``\usepackage`` if STYLESHEET has no
extension or the extension ``.sty`` (the extension will be dropped). With
any other extension, the command ``\input`` is used.

It is possible to specify multiple style sheets (see examples below).

.. note::
  There is no need to specify a path, if your style files are installed
  in the `TeX input path`_.

If the ``--embed-stylesheet`` option is set, the content of every STYLESHEET
is inserted instead. Currently, this fails if the file is not available via
the given path (i.e. without search in the `TeX input path`_).

Examples:

* Times Roman fonts with `mathptmx` package::

    --stylesheet==mathptmx

  or ::

    --stylesheet==mathptmx.sty

* Input ``preamble.tex``::

   --stylesheet==preamble.tex

* Use three style sheets: `mathptmx` Times fonts,
  `parskip`  separate paragraphs by vertical space,
  `preamble.tex` home-made custom style sheet::

    --stylesheet==mathptmx,parskip,preamble.tex

Stylesheet Repository
  There is a `repository of user-contributed style
  sheets`_ in the Docutils Sandbox_.

.. _TeX input path:
   http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=what-TDS
.. _repository of user-contributed style sheets:
   ../../../sandbox/stylesheets/
.. _sandbox: ../../../sandbox/


Raw LaTeX
---------

By means of the `raw directive`_ one can give commands directly to LaTeX.

This can be both, styling and printing commands, as LaTeX (unlike HTML/CSS)
uses one common language for content and style.

This means that most of the example code for the style sheet will also work
as raw LaTeX inside the document. An exception are commands that need to be
given in the document preamble (e.g. package loading with ``\usepackage``,
which can be done with the ``--style-sheet`` command line option instead).

Examples:

* Forcing a page break::

    .. raw:: latex

       \newpage

* Math formula::

    .. raw:: latex

       \[x^3 + 3x^2a + 3xa^2 + a^3,\]

  (Drawback: the formula will be invisible in other output formats.)

* Making a "colorbox": If someone wants to get a red background for a
  text block, she/he can define ``\definecolor{bg}{rgb}{.9,0,0}`` in a custom
  style sheet and in the document do something like this::

    |begincolorbox|
    Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition.
    |endcolorbox|

    .. |begincolorbox| raw:: latex

       \\begin{center}
       \\colorbox{bg}{
       \\parbox{0.985\\linewidth}{

    .. |endcolorbox| raw:: latex

       }}
       \\end{center}

.. _raw directive:
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#raw


Docutils special LaTeX macros
-----------------------------

Some Docutils objects have no LaTeX counterpart, they will be typeset using
a Docutils specific LaTeX macro. The specific commands, environments, and
lenghts allow layout changes from the style sheet. By convention, these
special definitions use the prefix ``\DU``\ [#]_.

The generated LaTeX documents should be kept processable by a standard LaTeX
installation. Therefore fallback definitions are included after the custom
style sheet, if the macro is needed in the document.

* `Custom style sheets`_ can define alternative implementations with
  ``\newcommand``, ``\newenvironment``, and ``\newlenght`` plus
  ``\setlength``.

* Definitions with `raw LaTeX`_ are part of the document body. Use
  ``\def``, ``\renewcommand`` or ``\renewenvironment``, and ``\setlenght``.

How to configure the ...
------------------------

admonitions
```````````

Admonitions__ are specially marked "topics" that can appear anywhere an
ordinary body element can.

Default:
  typeset in a frame using a sans-serif font.

Length:
  ``\DUadmonitionwidth``: the width of admonitions.

Default:
  90 % of text width: ``0.9\textwidth``

Example:
  set to 70% of text width::

    \newlength{\DUadmonitionwidth}
    \setlength{\DUadmonitionwidth}{0.7\textwidth}

__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#admonitions

custom interpreted text roles
`````````````````````````````

The rst `role directive`_ allows defining custom `text roles`_
that mark parts of inline text (spans) with a class argument.

* Role names and class arguments are are converted to conform to the regular
  expression ``[a-z][-a-z0-9]*`` (see `class directive`_).

* Class arguments may contain numbers and hyphens, which need special
  treatment in LaTeX command names. (The special command ``\@namedef`` can
  help with the definition of corresponding commands.)

* Custom roles can have multiple class arguments

  In contrast to HTML/CSS, the order of the class arguments might matter.

Commands:
  ``\DUrole``: dispatcher command

  ``\docutilsroleCLASSARGUMENT``\ [#]_: optional styling command

.. [#] The prefix ``\docutilsrole...`` instead of ``\DUrole...`` in the
   styling commands is kept for backwards compatibility.

Default:
  The definition of ``\DUrole{CLASSARGUMENT}{}`` calls the macro named
  ``\docutilsroleCLASSARGUMENT{}`` if it is defined (but silently ignores
  this class argument if a corresponding macro is not defined).

Examples:

* Typeset text in small caps::
  
    .. role:: smallcaps
  
    :smallcaps:`Fourier` transformation
  
  This is transformed to the LaTeX code::
  
    \DUrole{smallcaps}{Fourier} transformation
  
  The default definition of ``\DUrole`` will look for a macro named
  ``\docutilsrolesmallcaps``. The definition ::
  
    \newcommand{\docutilsrolesmallcaps}{\textsc}
  
  as `raw LaTeX`_ or in the custom style sheet will give the expected result
  (if the chosen font supports small caps).
  
* Subscript text in normal size and *italic* shape::
  
  .. role:: sub(subscript)
  
  As "sub" inherits from the standard "subscript" role, the LaTeX macro
  only needs to set the size and shape::
  
    \newcommand{\docutilsrolesub}{\normalsize\itshape}
  
* A role with several classes and a converted class name::
  
    .. role:: custom4
       :class: argI argII arg_3
  
  is translated to the nested commands::
  
    \DUrole{argi}{\DUrole{argii}{\DUrole{arg-3}{<content>}}}
  
  With the definitions::
  
    \newcommand{\docutilsroleargi}[1]{\textsc}
    \newcommand{\docutilsroleargii}[1]{{\large #1}}
    \makeatletter
    \@namedef{docutilsrolearg-3}{\textbf}
    \makeatother
  
  in a style sheet\ [#]_ or as `raw LaTeX`_ in the document source,
  text styled with ``:custom4:`large bold small-caps``` will be typeset
  accordingly.

.. [#] Leave out the ``\makeatletter`` - ``\makeatother`` pair if the style
   sheet is a LaTeX package (``*.sty``).

definition lists
`````````````````

ReStructuredText `definition lists`__ correspond to HTML ``<dl>`` list
objects.

Environment:
  ``description``: LaTeX standard environment

Command:
  ``\descriptionlabel``: styling macro for the description term

Default:
  bold label text, hanging indent

Example:
  A non-bold label can be achieved with::

    \renewcommand\descriptionlabel[1]{\hspace\labelsep \normalfont #1}

__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#definition-lists


document class
``````````````

The LaTeX document class cannot be changed in a style sheet.

Option:

--documentclass=DOCUMENTCLASS
                        Specify documentclass.  Default is "article".

Standard document classes:
  article, report, book
  
There are hundreds of alternative LaTeX document classes installed by modern
LaTeX distributions, provided by publishers or available at CTAN_ e.g.
 
* scrarticle, scrreport, scrbook: KOMA-script_ classes
* memoir_

The `TeX Catalogue`_ lists most of them.

.. _TeX Catalogue:
   http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/help/Catalogue/


document info
`````````````

Content of the `bibliographic fields`__ at the top of a document.
By default, docinfo items are typeset as a table.

Options:

--use-latex-docinfo     Let LaTeX print author and date, do not show it in
                        docutils document info.
--use-latex-abstract    Use LaTeX abstract environment for the documents
                        abstract. Per default the abstract is an unnumbered
                        section.

Length:
  ``\DUdocinfowidth``: the width for the `docinfo` table.

Default:
  90 % of text width: ``0.9\textwidth``

Example:
  set to 70% of text width::

    \newlength{\DUdocinfowidth}
    \setlength{\DUdocinfowidth}{0.7\textwidth}

__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#bibliographic-fields


font encoding
`````````````

Option:

--font-encoding=FONT_ENCODING
                        LaTeX font encoding. Possible values are "", "T1",
                        "OT1", "LGR,T1" or any other combination of options to
                        the `fontenc`_ package. Default is "" which does not
                        load `fontenc`.

Examples:
  
* The recommended setting for Latin based scripts is "T1" together with a
  T1-encoded "Type 1" (vector) font, for example `Latin Modern`_::

    --font-encoding=T1 --stylesheet=lmodern
    
* Support for characters in the Unicode blocks Latin, Latin-1 Supplement,
  and Greek::
  
    --font-encoding=LGR,T1

   http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/macros/latex/doc/encguide.pdf

.. _Latin Modern:
   http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/help/Catalogue/entries/lm.html

hyphenation
```````````

The amount of hyphenation is influenced by ``\hyphenpenalty``, setting it to
10000 almost prevents hyphenation. As this produces lines with more space
between words one should increase Latex's ``\tolerance`` for this.

Example:
  ::

    \hyphenpenalty=5000
    \tolerance=1000


images
``````

Images__ are included in LaTeX with the help of the `graphicx` package. The
supported image formats depend on the used driver (dvi, dvips, pdftex, ...).

If PDF-image inclusion in PDF files fails, specifying
``--graphicx-option=pdftex`` or ``--graphicx-option=auto`` might help.

__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#images


line blocks
```````````

In `line blocks`__, newlines and leading whitespace are respected.

Environment:
  ``DUlineblock``: special list environment for line blocks
Length:
  ``\DUlineblockindent``: indentation of indented lineblock parts.

Default:
   2.5 times the font hight: ``2.5em``

Example:
  set to the paragraph indentation::

    \newlength{\DUlineblockindent}
    \setlength{\DUlineblockindent}{\parindent}

__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#line-blocks

line spacing
````````````

Commands:
  ``\linespread``: for small adjustments

  ``\singlespacing``, ``\onehalfspacing``, and ``\doublespacing``: from
  package `setspace`

Examples:

* Get document wide double spacing::

    \usepackage{setspace}
    \doublespacing

* Increase line spacing by five percent for better readability::

    \linespread{1.05}


literal blocks
``````````````

No markup processing is done within a `literal block`__. It is left as-is,
and is typically rendered in a monospaced typeface

Options:

--literal-block-env=LITERAL_BLOCK_ENV
                      When possibile\ [#]_, use the specified environment for
                      literal-blocks. Default is quoting of whitespace and
                      special chars.

.. [#] A literal-block element, when processed by a Docutils writer might
   have it's origin in a markup with "::" syntax or a ".. parsed-literal::"
   directive.

   A LaTeX verbatim environment is only usable if there is no other markup
   contained in the literal-block.


Example:

  ``--literal-env=lstlisting``

  The ``lstlisting`` environment is highly configurable (as documented in
  listings.pdf_), for instance ::

    \renewcommand{\ttdefault}{txtt}
    \lstset{language=Python,
            morekeywords=[1]{yield}
    }
    \lstloadlanguages{Python}
    \lstset{
      basicstyle=\ttfamily,
      keywordstyle=\bfseries,
      commentstyle=\rmfamily\itshape,
      stringstyle=\slshape,
    }
    \lstset{showstringspaces=false}
    \lstset{columns=fullflexible,
         basewidth={0.5em,0.4em}}

.. _listings.pdf:
    http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/listings/listings.pdf

list of figures/tables
``````````````````````

Docutils does not support lists of figures or tables.

However, with LaTeX, they can be generated using `raw LaTeX`_ in the
document source.

Commands:
  ``\listoffigures``: a list of figures

  ``\listoftables``: a list of tables

Example:
  ::

    .. raw:: latex

       \listoffigures

option list
```````````

`Option lists`__ are two-column lists of command-line options and
descriptions, documenting a program's options.

Environment:
  ``DUoptionlist``: environment for option lists,

Command:
  ``\DUoptionlistlabel``: set appearance of the options

Example:
  set command options with a bold monospace font::

    \newcommand{\DUoptionlistlabel}{\texttt{\textbf{#1}} \hfill}

__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#option-lists

page layout
```````````

By default, margin settings are determined by the `typearea`_ package which
is part of the `KOMA-script`_ bundle.  It is possible to disable the use of
the `typearea` package by not including the ``DIV`` setting in the
document options_.

The ``DIV`` document option defines how "crowded" a page will be: larger
values mean larger text area. 

    The typearea package even with option ``DIV=calc`` calculates a very
    generous text area. Many conservative typographers will state that the
    resulting line length is still excessive. The calculated DIV value may
    be found in the log file for the respective document. Thus one can
    select a smaller value easily after the first LaTeX run.
    
    -- `KOMA-Script Guide`_

Default: 
  ``DIV=12`` (resulting in good paper use at the expense of unreadable long
  lines). 
  
  The `typearea` default for A4 paper and 10 pt fonts is ``DIV=8``.

Examples:

* Let `typearea` choose a typografically sound value with
  ``DIV=default`` or ``DIV=calc``::

    --documentoptions='a4paper,DIV=calc'

* Disable the `typearea` package loading with::

    --documentoptions='a4paper'

  and use the documentclass default or set margins in a stylesheet with
  the `geometry` package::

    \usepackage{geometry}
    \geometry{hmargin={3cm,0.8in},height=8in}
    \geometry{height=10in}.

  For details see the `geometry manual`_.

page numbering
``````````````

Example:
  Number pages by chapter

  This can be accomplished with the chappg_ package::

    \usepackage{chappg}

  See the `chappg documentation`_ for details.

.. _chappg: http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/help/Catalogue/entries/chappg.html
.. _chappg documentation:
   http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/chappg/chappg.pdf


paper size
``````````

Paper geometry can be changed using ``--documentoptions`` or with the
package `geometry` and ``\geometry{OPTIONLIST}`` LaTeX commands in a style
sheet.

Default:
  a4paper

Some possibilities:

* a4paper, b3paper, letterpaper, executivepaper, legalpaper
* landscape, portrait, twoside.

Examples:

* Choose A5 pager in landscape orientation with command line argument::

    --documentoptions=a5paper,landscape

* The same with LaTeX commands in the style sheet::

    \usepackage{geometry}
    \geometry{a5paper,landscape}

  For details see the `geometry manual`_.

paragraph indent
````````````````

Default (in most document classes):
  Indent the first line in a paragraph unless it is the first line of a
  chapter, section, subsection, or subsubsection.

Example:
  To set paragraph indentation to zero but add a vertical space between
  load the `parskip` package with the command line argument::

    --stylesheet=parskip

  or in your style sheet with::

    \usepackage{parskip}


rubric
``````

A rubric__ is like an informal heading that doesn't correspond to the
document's structure.

Command:
  ``\DUrubric``

Default:
  subsection style italic, centred

Example:
  set rubric to subsection style, flushleft and red::

    \newcommand{\DUrubric}[1]{\subsection*{{\color{red}#1}\hfill~}}

__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#rubric

title reference role
````````````````````

`Title reference`_ is the default `default role`_ for `interpreted text`_.

Command:
  ``\DUroletitlereference``

Default:
  use slanted font (``\textsl``)

Example:
  set title references with a bold monospace font::

    \newcommand{\DUroletitlereference}[1]{\texttt{\textbf{#1}}}

text font
`````````

Unfortunately, LaTeX cannot use the fonts of the operating system directly
[#]_ but needs specially installed fonts with additional supporting files.
The `LaTeX Font Catalogue`_ provides information and examples for a wide
range of fonts available for use with LaTeX.

.. [#] XeTeX_ can, but is not (yet) supported by Docutils

Default:
  Computer Modern (CM)

Alternative fonts can be selected by

a) specifying the corresponding LaTeX package as arguments to the
   ``--stylesheet`` option or in a custom style sheet.
   
   * Packages can be combined.
   * Passing options to a package is only possible in the style sheet.
   
b) changing the font-default macros.


Examples:

* Use `LaTeX Modern`, a Type 1 variant of CM.

  LaTeX code::

    \usepackage{lmodern}

  Command line argument::

    --stylesheet=lmodern

* The ubiquitous "Times/Helvetica/Courier"
  combination is achieved by::

    \usepackage{mathptmx}            % Times for serif and math
    \usepackage[scaled=.90]{helvet}  % downscaled Helvetica for sans serif
    \usepackage{courier}             % Courier for teletype (mono-space)

* Changing a font without using a package (the macros are ``\rmdefault``,
  ``sfdefault`` and ``ttdefault``)::

    \renewcommand{\ttdefault}{txtt}


When generating PDF-files from LaTeX, the files can become smaller if
standard Postscript fonts are used.

The following table lists the font packages for standard Postscript fonts
(see `Using common Postscript fonts with LaTeX`_ for details):

Extended versions of the standard Postscript fonts including accented chars,
Greek and Cyrillic are available with the `TeX Gyre`_ bundle which is part
of, e.g., `TeX Live`_.

text encoding
`````````````

Default:
  The generated LaTeX documents are in the input encoding.

Example:
  Use latin1 text encoding for the LaTeX source::

    --output-encoding=latin1

.. this is no longer true. TODO: describe the state of the art
   If the source document is in utf-8 encoding (or
   ``--output-encoding=utf-8`` is set), LaTeX needs Unicode support (the
   `ucs` package). If this package is not available, specify a different
   output-encoding, e.g. ``latin1``.

   If LaTeX issues a Warning about unloaded/unknown characters adding ::

    \PreloadUnicodePage{n}

   (where *n* is the Unicode page-number) to the style sheet might help.

   .. _LaTeX Unicode: http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/latex/unicode/

* Unicode box drawing characters:

  - generate LaTeX code with ``--output-encoding=utf-8:strict``.

  - In the latex file, edit the preamble to load "ucs" with "postscript"
    option and also load the pstricks package::

      - \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
      + \usepackage[postscript]{ucs}
      + \usepackage{pstricks}
      + \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}

  - Convert to PDF with ``latex``, ``dvips``, and ``ps2pdf``.


title page
``````````

.. TODO: find out and describe the state of the art

Currently the title page only shows the title and subtitle, date and author
are shown in the `docinfo` table. To change the title-page layout one must
redefine the ``\maketitle`` command in the stylesheet

Example:
 ::

  \makeatletter
  \renewcommand{\maketitle}{
    \begin{titlepage}
      \begin{center}
      \textsf{TITLE \@title} \\
      Date: \today
      \end{center}
    \end{titlepage}
  }

The macro ``\@title`` contains the title.


section numbering
`````````````````

The options ``--section-numbering`` and ``--use-latex-toc``, both
influence section numbering.

* If ``--use-latex-toc`` is specified the latex-writer generates
  LaTeX output, so that LaTeX generates a table of contents and
  generates section numbers. Usually one does not want to have
  section numbers generated by Docutils in this case, therefore
  ``--no-section-numbering`` should be specified.

  The advantage is that LaTeX does put page numbers into the
  table of contents, but the section depth is limited by the
  used LaTeX document class, usually to four levels.

* If section numbering and LaTeX table of contents is used LaTeX and
  Docutils will number sections. To switch off displaying of Latex's
  numbers one has to add following lines to the style sheet ::

    % no section number display
    \makeatletter
    \def\@seccntformat#1{}
    \makeatother
    % no numbers in toc
    \renewcommand{\numberline}[1]{}

  This enables to have the same section numbers as in other Docutils
  writers and page numbers in the table of contents.

size of a pixel (length unit ``px``)
````````````````````````````````````

The length unit ``px`` stands for `pixel` and its value has varying
definitions:

  :pdftex:   defines 1px = 1bp = 1/72 in, i.e. 72 DPI (dots per inch)
  :CSS:      defines 1 px = 1/96 in, i.e. 92 DPI
  :browsers: use the actual screen resolution (or what they think it is)
             (usually between 72 DPI and 100 DPI).

Example:
  Set a "resolution" of 92 dots per inch::

       \pdfpxdimen=1in % 1 DPI
       \divide\pdfpxdimen by 92 % 92 DPI


Error ``illegal unit px``:
  The unit ``px`` is not defined in "pure" LaTeX, but introduced by the
  `pdfTeX` converter on 2005-02-04. `pdfTeX` is used in all modern LaTeX
  distributions (since ca. 2006) also for conversion into DVI format.

  If you convert the LaTeX source with a legacy program, you might get the
  error ``illegal unit px``.

  If updating LaTeX is not an option, just remove the ``px`` from the length
  specification. HTML/CSS will default to ``px`` while the `latexe2` writer
  will add the fallback unit ``bp``.


Changes
=======

* The Docutils HISTORY_ lists all changes during the history of docutils.

* Changes since the last release (0.5) are summarized in the RELEASE-NOTES_
  and explained in detail in docutils-05-compat_.

* docutils-05-compat.sty_ is a style sheet that provides best possible
  backwards compatibility.

Problems
========

Open to be fixed or open to discussion.

See also the entries in the `Docutils TODO list`_ and the discussion and
proposals in the `latex-variants`_ sandbox project.

Lists
-----

Definitions in definition lists start on the same line as the term. Putting
``\leavevmode`` after the term results in a new newline if the definition
starts with a bullet list or similar.

Footnotes and citations
-----------------------

Initially both were implemented using figures, because hyperlinking back
and forth seemed to be impossible. Later images were put into figures.

This results in footnotes images and figures possibly being mixed at page
foot.

* Use LaTeX footnotes and citations for printing or more complex layout.
* Footnotes and citations done with figures might excell in hyperlink
  support.

If ``use-latex-citations`` is used a bibliography is inserted right at
the end of the document. *This should be customizable*.

If ``use-latex-citations`` is used adjacent citation references (separated
only by a single space or a newline) are combined to a single citation
group, i.e. ``[cite1]_ [cite2]_`` results in ``\cite{cite1,cite2}``.

Tables
------

:Tablewidth: reST-documents line length is assumed to be 80 characters. The
             tablewidth is set relative to this value. If someone produces
             documents with line length of 132 this will fail.

             Table width is tried to fit in page even if it is wider than
             the assumed linewidth, still assumed linewidth is a hook.

* In tools.txt the option tables right column, there should be some more
  spacing between the description and the next paragraph "Default:".

* Paragraph separation in tables is hairy.
  see http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=struttab

  - The strut solution did not work.
  - setting extrarowheight added ad top of row not between paragraphs in
    a cell. ALTHOUGH i set it to 2pt because, text is too close to the topline.
  - baselineskip/stretch does not help.

* Should there be two hlines after table head and on table end ?

* Table: multicol cells are always {l}.

* The contents of a rowspan cell do not influence table height.
  (multirow "feature", use a phantom or strut?)

* The frame around a multirow cell in the last column is incomplete
  (see functional test output standalone_rst_latex.tex).
  Actually, the writer inserts too many && in lines following the rowspan
  (see `<../../../sandbox/latex-variants/tests/table-with-spans.txt>`__).

* Table cells with both multirow and multicolumn are currently not possible.

* literal-blocks in table cells:

  - If verbatim or flushleft is used one gets vertical space above and below.
  - This is bad for the topmost paragraph in a cell, therefore the writer
    uses raggedright.
  - Ragged right fails on followup paragraphs as the vertical space would be
    missing.

* Use tabularx column type ``X`` and let LaTeX decide width.

* csv-tables do not have a colwidth.

* ``--table-style=booktabs``, ``..class:: booktab``: `booktabs` version
  1.00 does not work with `longtable`. This is solved in newer versions
  (current is 2005/04/14 v1.61803).

Figures
-------
Wrapping text around figures is currently not supported.
(Requires the `wrapfig`_ package.)

.. _wrapfig: http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/help/Catalogue/entries/wrapfig.html


Miscellaneous
-------------

.. * Selection of LaTeX fontsize configurable (needs an option).
   What is wrong with ``--documentoptions=12`` or so,
   maybe combined with extsize or some other package? [GM]

* recognize LaTeX and replace by ``\LaTeX`` (or not?).

* Pdfbookmark level 4 (and greater) does not work (might be settable but
  complicated).

* Consider peter funk's hooks for TeXpert (or use a `template file`__)?

  * Define his own document preamble (including the choice to
    choose his own documentclass.  That would make the ``--documentclass``
    option superfluous).  I suggest to call this option ``--preamble``
  * Use two additional hooks to put additional stuff just behind the
    ``\begin{document}`` and just before the ``\end{document}`` macros.
    Typical uses would be ``\tableofcontents``, ``\listoffigures`` and
    ``\appendix``, ``\makeindex``, ``\makeglossary`` and some such
    for larger documents.
    
* Footnotes are not all on the same page (as in
  docs/user/rst/demo.txt) and do not link back and forth.

* Hyperlinks are not hyphenated; this leads to bad spacing. See
  docs/user/rst/demo.txt 2.14 directives.
  
* Pagestyle headings does not work, when sections are starred.

* For additional docinfo items: the field_body is inserted as text, i.e. no
  markup is done.

* Multiple author entries in docinfo (same thing as in html).
  (already solved?)

* Keep literal-blocks together on a page, avoid pagebreaks.

  Failed experiments up to now: samepage, minipage, pagebreak 1 to 4 before
  the block.

  Should be possible with ``--literal-block-env==lstlistings``.
  
* Enable the choice between ``utf8`` (standard `fontenc`) and ``utf8x``
  (`ucs`) text encoding.

* LaTeX does not support multiple tocs in one document.
  (might be no limitation except for docutils documentation)

  However, the "minitoc" latex package can produce per-chapter tocs in
  book and report document classes.
