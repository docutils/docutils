 Docutils Project Documentation Overview
=========================================

:Date: $Date$
:Revision: $Revision$

The latest working documents may be accessed individually below, or
from the ``docs`` directory of the `development snapshots`__.  They
are also distributed with the `latest project release package`__, but
those may not be completely up to date.

Docutils Stakeholders
=====================

There are several distinct groups of Docutils stakeholders:

1. End-users: users of reStructuredText and the Docutils tools.
   Although some are developers (e.g. Python developers utilizing
   reStructuredText for docstrings in their source), many are not.

2. Client-developers: developers using Docutils as a library,
   programmers developing *with* Docutils.

3. Component-developers: those who implement application-specific
   components, directives, and/or roles, without contributing them
   back to Docutils.

4. Core-developers: developers of the Docutils codebase and
   participants in the Docutils project community.

5. Re-implementers: developers of alternate implementations of
   Docutils.

There's a lot of overlap between these groups.  Most (perhaps all)
core-developers, component-developers, client-developers, and
re-implementers are also end-users.  Core-developers are also
library-user/developers, and may also be component-developers in other
projects.  Component-developers are also client-developers.


Project Fundamentals
====================

These files are for all Docutils stakeholders.  They are kept at the
top level of the Docutils project directory.

:README.txt_: Project overview: quick-start, requirements,
              installation, and usage.
:COPYING.txt_: Conditions for Docutils redistribution, with links to
               licenses.
:FAQ.txt_: Docutils Frequently Asked Questions.  If you have a
           question or issue, there's a good chance it's already
           answered here.  Please take a look.
:BUGS.txt_: A list of known bugs, and how to report a bug.
:HISTORY.txt_: Change history log.
:THANKS.txt_: Acknowledgements.

``user/``: Introductory/Tutorial Material for End-Users
=======================================================

Docutils-general:

* `Docutils Front-End Tools <user/tools.html>`__
* `Docutils Configuration Files <user/config.html>`__
* `Docutils LaTeX Writer <user/latex.html>`__

`reStructuredText <../rst.html>`_:

* `A ReStructuredText Primer (HTML) <user/rst/quickstart.html>`__ (or
  `text source <user/rst/quickstart.txt>`__)
* `Quick reStructuredText <user/rst/quickref.html>`__ (user reference)
* `reStructuredText Cheat Sheet <user/rst/cheatsheet.txt>`__ (text
  only; 1 page for syntax, 1 page directive & role reference)


``ref/``: Reference Material for All Groups
===========================================

Many of these files began as developer specifications, but now that
they're mature and used by end-users and client-developers, they have
become reference material.  Successful specs evolve into refs.

Docutils-general:

* `The Docutils Document Tree <ref/doctree.html>`__ (incomplete)
* `Docutils Transforms <ref/transforms.html>`__
* `Docutils Generic DTD <ref/docutils.dtd>`__
* `OASIS XML Exchange Table Model Declaration Module
  <ref/soextblx.dtd>`__ (CALS tables DTD module)

Although not in the "ref" directory, `PEP 258 <peps/pep-0258.html>`_
is a must-read reference for any Docutils developer.

reStructuredText_:

* `An Introduction to reStructuredText <ref/rst/introduction.html>`__
  (includes the `Goals <ref/rst/introduction.html#goals>`__ and
  `History <ref/rst/introduction.html#history>`__ of reStructuredText)
* `reStructuredText Markup Specification <ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`__
* `reStructuredText Directives <ref/rst/directives.html>`__
* `reStructuredText Interpreted Text Roles <ref/rst/roles.html>`__


``howto/``: Instructions for Component-Developers and Core-Developers
=====================================================================

* `Docutils Internationalization <howto/i18n.html>`__
* `Creating reStructuredText Directives <howto/rst-directives.html>`__
* `Creating reStructuredText Interpreted Text Roles
  <howto/rst-roles.html>`__


``peps/``: Python Enhancement Proposals
=======================================

* `PEP 256: Docstring Processing System Framework`__ is a high-level
  generic proposal.  [`PEP 256`__ in the `master repository`_]
* `PEP 257: Docstring Conventions`__ addresses docstring style and
  touches on content.  [`PEP 257`__ in the `master repository`_]
* `PEP 258: Docutils Design Specification`__ documents design issues
  and implementation details for Docutils (this project), a specific
  docstring processing system.  [`PEP 258`__ in the `master
  repository`_]
* `PEP 287: reStructuredText Docstring Format`__ proposes a standard
  markup syntax.  [`PEP 287`__ in the `master repository`_]

Please note that PEPs in the `master repository`_ may not be current,
whereas the local versions are.
