This document documents my trial to build python wheels from 
docutils. Once it is finished it might be driven into distribution or
release documentation.

There is `feature request 43`_ :  Make setup.py build wheels. 

  Just add this to setup.cfg:

  [bdist_wheel]
  universal = 1

  See https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html#universal-wheels

  -.-.-
  
  Docutils is not fit for Universal Wheels. Docutils supports both Python 2 and
  3, but with different code (we use “2to3”). This would make it a candidate
  for "Pure Python wheels".

and bugs275_ : Upload wheels to pypi 

  Currently docutils does not publish any wheels on pypi. Wheels make docutils
  faster to install (no need to run setup.py, which for a large number of
  packages can take some time), and is no more difficult than uploading an
  sdist (see https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html#wheels
  for instructions).
