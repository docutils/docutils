To Do
=====

Priority items are marked with "@" symbols.  The more @s, the higher
the priority.  Items in question form (containing "?") are ideas which
require more thought and debate; they are potential to-do's.

Many of these items are awaiting champions.  If you see something
you'd like to tackle, please do!


Bugs
----

- The "contents" directive now automatically names the "topic"
  produced (using its title), so that it can be referred to by name.
  However, this naming happens late in the game, after most references
  have been resolved.  So the following indirect target produces a
  warning because the name "contents" is not available when resolved::

      .. contents::

      .. _alternate name for contents: contents_

  Fixing this may be tricky, and isn't a high priority.

  Idea: two-pass hyperlink resolution, ignoring errors on the first
  pass?

- Section headers must have underlines at least 4 characters long.
  But when the section title is only 3 characters long, it's natural
  to underline with "===" (I just did).  The parser should produce a
  warning in such cases.

- The parser doesn't know anything about double-width characters such
  as Chinese hanza & Japanese kanji/kana.  Also, it's dependent on
  whitespace and punctuation as markup delimiters, which may not be
  applicable in these languages.

- @@@ This shouldn't be recognized as a list item::

      A. Einstein was a really
      smart dude.

  Or this::

      1. This is the heading of section one
      =====================================

  What about this? ::

      A. Einstein was a really smart dude.

      More text.

  It's a list item followed by a paragraph.  Just document it as a
  corner case and require escaping if it's not a list item.  E.g.::

      \A. Einstein was a really smart dude.

  This should definitely be a list::

      A. Einstein was a really smart dude.
      B. So was Carl Sagan.

  But what about this?  Accidents can happen::

      A. Einstein was a great influence on
      B. Physicist, who was a colleague of
      C. Chemist.  They all worked in
      Princeton, NJ.

  The first two lines indicate a list.  The third item, "C.", should
  be interpreted as a paragraph because of the fourth line.  An
  "Enumerated list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent at
  line 3" warning shall be generated.

  (Bug reports by Jeremy Hylton and Dmitry Jemerov.)


General
-------

- Refactor

  - Rename methods & variables according to the `coding conventions`_
    below.

  - The name-to-id conversion and hyperlink resolution code needs to be
    checked for correctness and refactored.  I'm afraid it's a bit of
    a spaghetti mess now.

- Add validation?  See http://pytrex.sourceforge.net, RELAX NG.

- Ask Python-dev for opinions (GvR for a pronouncement) on special
  variables (__author__, __version__, etc.): convenience vs. namespace
  pollution.  Ask opinions on whether or not Docutils should recognize
  & use them.

- In reader.get_reader_class (& parser & writer too), should we be
  importing "standalone" or "docutils.readers.standalone"?  (This would
  avoid importing top-level modules if the module name is not in
  docutils/readers.  Potential nastiness.)

- Perhaps store a name-to-id mapping file?  This could be stored
  permanently, read by subsequent processing runs, and updated with
  new entries.  ("Persistent ID mapping"?)

- Need a Unicode to HTML entities codec for HTML writer?

- Perhaps the ``Component.supports`` method should deal with
  individual features ("meta" etc.) instead of formats ("html" etc.)?

- Should transforms have a priority system?  Is the "first reader" ...
  "last writer" system adequate for pending transforms?


Documentation
-------------

- User docs.


Implementation Docs
```````````````````

- Internal module documentation (docstrings).

- spec/doctree.txt: DTD element structural relationships, semantics,
  and attributes.

- How a Writer works & how to write one

- Howto: Transforms

- Howto: Directives

- Document the ``pending`` elements and when they're triggered ("first
  reader", "last writer", etc.).

- Document the transforms (perhaps in docstrings?): how they're used,
  what they do, dependencies & order considerations.


Specification
`````````````

- Complete PEP 258 Docutils Design Specification.

  - Fill in the blanks in API details.

  - Specify the nodes.py internal data structure implementation?

        [Tibs:] Eventually we need to have direct documentation in
        there on how it all hangs together - the DTD is not enough
        (indeed, is it still meant to be correct?  [Yes, it is.]).

- Rework PEP 257, separating style from spec from tools, wrt Docutils?
  See Doc-SIG from 2001-06-19/20.


PySource Reader
---------------

- Analyze Tony Ibbs' PySource code.

- Analyze Doug Hellmann's HappyDoc project.

- Take the best ideas and integrate them into Docutils 0.3.


reStructuredText Parser
-----------------------

Also see the `... Or Not To Do?`__ list.

__ rst/alternatives.html#or-not-to-do

- Clean up the code; refactor as required.

- Add motivation sections for constructs in spec.

- Allow very long titles (on two or more lines)?

- And for the sake of completeness, should definition list terms be
  allowed to be very long (two or more lines) also?

- Support generic hyperlink references to targets in other documents?
  Not in an HTML-centric way, though (it's trivial to say
  ``http://www.example.com/doc#name``, and useless in non-HTML
  contexts).  XLink/XPointer?  ``.. baseref::``?  See Doc-SIG
  2001-08-10.

- Add _`character processing`?  For example:

  - ``--`` to em-dash (or ``--`` to en-dash, and ``---`` to em-dash).
    (Look for pre-existing conventions.)
  - Convert quotes to curly quote entities.  (Essentially impossible
    for HTML?  Unnecessary for TeX.  An output issue?)
  - Various forms of ``:-)`` to smiley icons.
  - ``"\ "`` to &nbsp;.
  - Escaped newlines to <BR>.
  - Escaped period or quote as a disappearing catalyst to allow
    character-level inline markup?
  - Others?

  How to represent character entities in the text though?  Probably as
  Unicode.

  Which component is responsible for this, the parser, the reader, or
  the writer?

- Implement the header row separator modification to table.el.  (Wrote
  to Takaaki Ota & the table.el mailing list on 2001-08-12, suggesting
  support for "=====" header rows.  On 2001-08-17 he replied, saying
  he'd put it on his to-do list, but "don't hold your breath".)

- Tony says inline markup rule 7 could do with a *little* more
  exposition in the spec, to make clear what is going on for people
  with head colds.

- Alan Jaffray suggested (and I agree) that it would be sensible to:

  - have a directive to specify a default role for interpreted text
  - allow the reST processor to take an argument for the default role
  - issue a warning when processing documents with no default role
    which contain interpreted text with no explicitly specified role

- Perhaps the default implicit role for interpreted text could be
  "title", as in, "title of a book".  It'd be a text-only reference,
  no hyperlink.  Idea from Aahz' 2002-05-09 Doc-SIG post.

- @@ Fix the parser's indentation handling to conform with the
  stricter definition in the spec.  (Explicit markup blocks should be
  strict or forgiving?)

- @@ Tighten up the spec for indentation of "constructs using complex
  markers": field lists and option lists?  Bodies may begin on the
  same line as the marker or on a subsequent line (with blank lines
  optional).  Require that for bodies beginning on the same line as
  the marker, all lines be in strict alignment.  Currently, this is
  acceptable::

      :Field-name-of-medium-length: Field body beginning on the same
          line as the field name.

  This proposal would make the above example illegal, instead
  requiring strict alignment.  A field body may either begin on the
  same line::

      :Field-name-of-medium-length: Field body beginning on the same
                                    line as the field name.

  Or it may begin on a subsequent line::

      :Field-name-of-medium-length:
          Field body beginning on a line subsequent to that of the
          field name.

  This would be especially relevant in degenerate cases like this::

      :Number-of-African-swallows-requried-to-carry-a-coconut:
          It would be very difficult to align the field body with
          the left edge of the first line if it began on the same
          line as the field name.

- Allow for variant styles by interpreting indented lists as if they
  weren't indented?  For example, currently the list below will be
  parsed as a list within a block quote::

      paragraph

        * list item 1
        * list item 2

  But a lot of people seem to write that way, and HTML browsers make
  it look as if that's the way it should be.  The parser could check
  the contents of block quotes, and if they contain only a single
  list, remove the block quote wrapper.  There would be two problems:

  1. What if we actually *do* want a list inside a block quote?

  2. What if such a list comes immediately after an indented
     construct, such as a literal block?

  Both could be solved using empty comments (problem 2 already exists
  for a block quote after a literal block).  But that's a hack.

  See the Doc-SIG discussion starting 2001-04-18 with Ed Loper's
  "Structuring: a summary; and an attempt at EBNF", item 4.

- Make the parser modular.  Allow syntax constructs to be added or
  disabled at run-time.  Or is subclassing enough?

- Continue to report (info, level 1) enumerated lists whose start
  value is not ordinal-1?

- Generalize the "doctest block" construct (which is overly
  Python-centric) to other interactive sessions?  "Doctest block"
  could be renamed to "I/O block" or "interactive block", and each of
  these could also be recognized as such by the parser:

  - Shell sessions::

        $ cat example1.txt
        A block beginning with a "$ " prompt is interpreted as a shell
        session interactive block.  As with Doctest blocks, the
        interactive block ends with the first blank line, and wouldn't
        have to be indented.

  - Root shell sessions::

        # cat example2.txt
        A block beginning with a "# " prompt is interpreted as a root
        shell session (the user is or has to be logged in as root)
        interactive block.  Again, the block ends with a blank line.

  Other standard (and unambiguous) interactive session prompts could
  easily be added (such as "> " for WinDOS).

  Tony Ibbs spoke out against this idea (2002-06-14 Doc-SIG thread
  "docutils feedback").

- Generalize the "literal block" construct to allow blocks with a
  per-line quoting to avoid indentation?  For example, in this email
  reply quoting the original, the block quoted with "``>``" (and
  prefaced by "``::``") would be treated as a literal block::

      John Doe wrote::

      >> Great idea!
      >
      > Why didn't I think of that?

      You just did!  ;-)

  The literal block would have to be a continuous text block (the
  first blank line ends it) where every line begins with the same
  non-alphanumeric non-whitespace character.

- @@@ Decide whether or not to implement Simon Budig's "inline
  external targets" syntax idea, and if so, how?

  - As a regular directive affecting its indented text block::

        .. inline-urls::

           This is an anonymous `reference <http://www.example.org
           /reference/>`__ of one word ("reference").  Here is a
           `phrase reference <http://www.example.org
           /phrase_reference/>`__.

  - As a pragma directive affecting the entire document (from that
    point on).  Perhaps a variation on the regular directive::

        .. inline-urls:: :global:

        Ordinary paragraphs ...

        This is an anonymous `reference <http://www.example.org
        /reference/>`__ of one word ("reference").  Here is a
        `phrase reference <http://www.example.org
        /phrase_reference/>`__.

    Perhaps "``:pragma:``" instead of "``:global:``"?  This pattern
    could be useful for other pragma directives: local-scope unless
    explicitly specified as global/pragma.

  - Or as a full-blown addition to the spec & parser.

- Add support for pragma (syntax-altering) directives.

- Remove leading numbers from section titles for implicit link names?
  A section titled "3. Conclusion" could then be referred to by
  "``Conclusion_``" (i.e., without the "3.").


Directives
``````````

- Allow directives to be added at run-time?

- Use the language module for directive attribute names?

- Add more attributes to the image directive: align, border?

- Implement directives.  Each of the list items below begins with an
  identifier of the form, "module_name.directive_function_name".  The
  directive name itself could be the same as the
  directive_function_name, or it could differ.

  - _`html.imagemap` (Useful outside of HTML?  If not, replace with
    image only in non-HTML writers?)

  - _`parts.endnotes`: See `Footnote & Citation Gathering`_.

  - _`parts.citations`: See `Footnote & Citation Gathering`_.

  - _`parts.sectnum`: Automatic section numbering.  Could be a
    command-line option also/instead.

    Something like this::
    
        .. sectnum::
    
        Section One
        ===========
    
        Section Two
        ===========
    
        Subsection One
        --------------
    
    When processed, the numbers "1", "2", and "2.1" would be prefixed
    to the titles automatically.  The directive name could be
    "sectnum" or "section-numbers" or "section-numbering", perhaps
    with a ":global:" attribute.  A ":depth:" attribute would also be
    useful (analogous to that of the "contents" directive).  Perhaps
    some kind of styling attribute as well?

    Add support to the "contents" directive.  Instead of bullet lists,
    the table of contents could be implemented with enumerated lists.
    Nested simple enumerators or compound enumerators ("2.1")?

  - _`misc.raw`

  - _`misc.include`: ``#include`` one file in another.  But how to
    parse wrt sections, reference names, conflicts?  Parse it in the
    current document's context (C-preprocessor semantics), or
    separately and then merge?

    Use C-preprocessor semantics for locating include files?  E.g.,
    ``.. include:: file.txt`` will read another file into the current
    one, relative to the current file's directory, and ``.. include::
    <standard>`` will read a standard include file from
    ``docutils/include/``.  (Should "quotes" be required around
    non-standard include files?)

  - _`misc.exec`: Execute Python code & insert the results.  Perhaps
    dangerous?

  - _`misc.eval`: Evaluate an expression & insert the text.  At parse
    time or at substitution time?  Dangerous?  Perhaps limit to canned
    macros; see text.date_ below.

  - _`misc.encoding`: Specify the character encoding of the input
    data.  But there are problems:

    - When it sees the directive, the parser will already have read
      the input data, and encoding determination will already have
      been done.

    - If a file with an "encoding" directive is edited and saved with
      a different encoding, the directive may cause data corruption.

  - _`misc.language`: Specify the language of a document.  There is a
    problem similar to the first problem listed for misc.encoding_,
    although to a lesser degree.

  - _`body.qa` (directive a.k.a. "faq", "questions"): Questions &
    Answers.  Implement as a generic two-column marked list?  As a
    standalone (non-directive) construct?  (Is the markup ambiguous?)
    Add support to parts.contents (optional attribute "qa" done).

    New elements would be required.  Perhaps::

        <!ELEMENT question_list (question_list_item+)>
        <!ATTLIST question_list
            numbering  (none | local | global)
                                #IMPLIED
            start     NUMBER    #IMPLIED>
        <!ELEMENT question_list_item (question, answer*)>
        <!ELEMENT question %text.model;>
        <!ELEMENT answer (%body.elements;)+>

    Originally I thought of implementing a Q&A list with special
    syntax::

        Q: What am I?

        A: You are a question-and-answer
           list.

        Q: What are you?

        A: I am the omniscient "we".

    Where each "Q" and "A" could also be numbered (e.g., "Q1").
    However, a simple enumerated or bulleted list will do just fine
    for syntax.  A directive could treat the list specially; e.g. the
    first paragraph could be treated as a question, the remainder as
    the answer (multiple answers could be represented by nested
    lists).  Without special syntax, this directive becomes low
    priority.

  - @@ _`body.verse`: Paragraphs with linebreaks preserved, *and*
    inline markup support too.  Use cases: verse (poetry, song lyrics,
    etc.), address blocks.  A directive would be easy; what about a
    literal-block-like prefix, perhaps "``;;``"?  (It is, after all, a
    *semi-literal* literal block, no?)  Example::

        Take it away, Eric the Orchestra Leader!  ;;

            A one, two, a one two three four

            Half a bee, philosophically,
            must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
            But half the bee has got to be,
            *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?

            But can a bee be said to be
            or not to be an entire bee,
            when half the bee is not a bee,
            due to some ancient injury?

            Singing...

    New elements would be required.  Perhaps::

        <!ELEMENT verse (stanza | verse)+>
        <!ELEMENT stanza (line+)>
        <!ELEMENT line %text.model;>

    We could get away without "line" elements, treating line breaks
    within "stanzas" as significant.  But explicit is perhaps better
    than implicit.

    Within a "verse" element, should any other constructs be allowed?
    Should lists be recognized?  No; verse blocks are variations on
    paragraphs, and need not contain arbitrary nested body elements.
    However, the equivalent of block quotes (i.e., further indented
    blocks) would be nested verse elements.  These could be "chorus"
    blocks.

    Perhaps individually indented "continuation lines" should also be
    recognized (maybe with a "continuation" attribute on the "line"
    element, or significant whitespace in a single "line")::

        "To Ma Own Beloved Lassie: A Poem on her 17th Birthday", by
        Ewan McTeagle (for Lassie O'Shea): ;;

            Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday.
            I'm absolutely skint.
            But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back
                as soon as it comes.
            Love, Ewan.

    Another idea for syntax: in an ordinary paragraph, if the first
    line ends with a backslash (escaping the newline), interpret the
    entire paragraph as a verse block?  This ties in to the `character
    processing`_ idea, above.  For example::

        Add just one backslash\
        And this paragraph becomes
        An awful haiku

    (And arguably invalid, since in Japanese the word "haiku" contains
    three syllables.)

    Directive/construct name alternatives: verse, address block,
    address, line block, lines, multi-line, free-form, keep lines,
    no-wrap, haiku, keep breaks, line breaks, obey lines, line-wise,
    text block, text art, text, line text, line list.  Current
    favorites: "line_block" for element name, "lines" for directive
    name.

  - _`body.example`: Examples; suggested by Simon Hefti.  Semantics as
    per Docbook's "example"; admonition-style, numbered, reference,
    with a caption/title.

  - _`body.index`: Index targets.

    Were I writing a book with an index, I guess I'd need two
    different kinds of index tags: inline/implicit and
    out-of-line/explicit.  For example::

        In this `paragraph`:index:, several words are being
        `marked`:index: inline as implicit `index`:index:
        entries.

        .. index:: markup
        .. index:: syntax

        The explicit index directives above would refer to
        this paragraph.

    The words "paragraph", "marked", and "index" would become index
    entries pointing at the words in the first paragraph.  The index
    entries appear verbatim in the text.  (Don't worry about the ugly
    ":index:" part; if indexing is the only application of interpreted
    text in your documents, it can be implicit and omitted.)  The two
    directives provide manual indexing, where the index entry words
    ("markup" and "syntax") do not appear in the main text.  We could
    combine the two directives into one::

        .. index:: markup; syntax

    Semicolons instead of commas because commas could *be* part of the
    index entry, like::

        .. index:: van Rossum, Guido

    Sometimes index entries have multiple levels.  Given::

        .. index:: statement syntax: expression statements

    In a hypothetical index, combined with other entries, it might
    look like this::

        statement syntax
            expression statements ..... 56
            assignment ................ 57
            simple statements ......... 58
            compound statements ....... 60

    Inline multi-level index targets could be done too.  Something
    like::

        When dealing with `expression statements <statement syntax:>`,
        we must remember ...

    The opposite sense could also be possible::

        When dealing with `index entries <:multi-level>`, there are
        many permutations to consider.

    Also "see / see also" index entries.

  - _`colorize.python`: Colorize Python code.  Fine for HTML output,
    but what about other formats?  Revert to a literal block?  Do we
    need some kind of "alternate" mechanism?  Perhaps use a "pending"
    transform, which could switch its output based on the "format" in
    use.  Use a factory function "transformFF()" which returns either
    "HTMLTransform()" instance or "GenericTransform" instance?

  - _`text.date`: Datestamp.  For substitutions.  The directive could
    be followed by a formatting string, using strftime codes.  Default
    is "%Y-%m-%d" (ISO 8601 date), but time fields can also be used.

    - Combined with misc.include_, implement canned macros?  E.g.::

          .. include:: <macros>

          Today's date is |date|.

      Where "macros" contains ``.. |date| date::``, among others.

  - _`text.time`: Timestamp.  For substitutions.  Shortcut for
    ``.. date:: %H:%M``.  Date fields can also be used.

  - _`pysource.usage`: Extract a usage message from the program,
    either by running it at the command line with a ``--help`` option
    or through an exposed API.  [Suggestion for Optik.]


Unimplemented Transforms
------------------------

Footnote & Citation Gathering
`````````````````````````````

Collect and move footnotes & citations to the end of a document.
(Separate transforms.)


Hyperlink Target Gathering
``````````````````````````

It probably comes in two phases, because in a Python context we need
to *resolve* them on a per-docstring basis [do we? --DG], but if the
user is trying to do the callout form of presentation, they would
then want to group them all at the end of the document.


Reference Merging
`````````````````

When merging two or more subdocuments (such as docstrings),
conflicting references may need to be resolved.  There may be:

- duplicate reference and/or substitution names that need to be made
  unique; and/or
- duplicate footnote numbers that need to be renumbered.

Should this be done before or after reference-resolving transforms
are applied?  What about references from within one subdocument to
inside another?


Document Splitting
``````````````````

If the processed document is written to multiple files (possibly in
a directory tree), it will need to be split up.  References will
have to be adjusted.

(HTML only?  For now, yes.)


Navigation
``````````

If a document is split up, each segment will need navigation links:
parent, children (small TOC), previous (preorder), next (preorder).
Part of `Document Splitting`_?


Others
``````

Index


HTML Writer
-----------

- @@ Construct a _`templating system`, as in ht2html/yaptu, using
  directives and substitutions for dynamic stuff.

- Add more support for <link> elements, especially for navigation
  bars.


Front-End Tools
---------------

- What about if we don't know which Reader and/or Writer we are
  going to use?  If the Reader/Writer is specified on the
  command-line?  (Will this ever happen?)

  Perhaps have different types of front ends:

  a) _`Fully qualified`: Reader and Writer are hard-coded into the
     front end (e.g. ``pep2html [options]``, ``pysource2pdf
     [options]``).

  b) _`Partially qualified`: Reader is hard-coded, and the Writer is
     specified a sub-command (e.g. ``pep2 html [options]``,
     ``pysource2 pdf [options]``).  The Writer is known before option
     processing happens, allowing the OptionParser to be built
     dynamically.  Alternatively, the Writer could be hard-coded and
     the Reader specified as a sub-command (e.g. ``htmlfrom pep
     [options]``).

  c) _`Unqualified`: Reader and Writer are specified as subcommands
     (e.g. ``publish pep html [options]``, ``publish pysource pdf
     [options]``).  A single front end would be sufficient, but
     probably only useful for testing purposes.

  d) _`Dynamic`: Reader and/or Writer are specified by options, with
     defaults if unspecified (e.g. ``publish --writer pdf
     [options]``).  Is this possible?  The option parser would have
     to be told about new options it needs to handle, on the fly.
     Component-specific options would have to be specified *after*
     the component-specifying option.

  Allow common options before subcommands, as in CVS?  Or group all
  options together?  In the case of the `fully qualified`_
  front ends, all the options will have to be grouped together
  anyway, so there's no advantage (we can't use it to avoid
  conflicts) to splitting common and component-specific options
  apart.

- Parameterize help text & defaults somehow?  Perhaps a callback?  Or
  initialize ``cmdline_options`` in ``__init__`` or ``init_options``?

- Disable common options that don't apply?


Project Policies
================

A few quotes sum up the policies of the Docutils project.  The IETF's
classic credo (by MIT professor Dave Clark) is an ideal we can aspire
to:

    We reject: kings, presidents, and voting.  We believe in: rough
    consensus and running code.

As architect, chief cook and bottle-washer, I currently function as
BDFN (Benevolent Dictator For Now), but I would happily abdicate the
throne given a suitable candidate.  Any takers?

Eric S. Raymond, anthropologist of the hacker subculture, writes in
his essay `The Magic Cauldron`_:

    The number of contributors [to] projects is strongly and inversely
    correlated with the number of hoops each project makes a user go
    through to contribute.

    .. _The Magic Cauldron:
       http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/magic-cauldron/

Therefore, we will endeavour to keep the barrier to entry as low as
possible.  The policies below should not be thought of as barriers,
but merely as a codification of experience to date.  These are "best
practices", not absolutes; exceptions are expected, tolerated, and
used as a source of improvement.

As for control issues, Emmett Plant (CEO of the Xiph.org Foundation,
originators of Ogg Vorbis) put it well when he said:

    Open source dictates that you lose a certain amount of control
    over your codebase, and that's okay with us.


Coding Conventions
------------------

These are the conventions I use in my own code.  Contributed code will
not be refused merely because it does not strictly adhere to these
conditions; as long as it's internally consistent, clean, and correct,
it probably will be accepted.  But don't be surprised if the
"offending" code gets fiddled over time to conform to these
conventions.

The Docutils project shall follow the generic coding conventions as
specified in the `Style Guide for Python Code`_ and `Docstring
Conventions`_ PEPs, with the following clarifications (from most to
least important):

- 4 spaces per indentation level.  No tabs.  Indent continuation lines
  according to the Emacs python-mode standard.

- No one-liner compound statements (i.e., no ``if x: return``: use two
  lines & indentation), except for degenerate class or method
  definitions (i.e., ``class X: pass`` is O.K.).

- Lines should be no more than 78 characters long.

- Use "StudlyCaps" for class names (except for element classes in
  docutils.nodes).

- Use "lowercase" or "lowercase_with_underscores" for function,
  method, and variable names.  For short names, maximum two words,
  joined lowercase may be used (e.g. "tagname").  For long names with
  three or more words, or where it's hard to parse the split between
  two words, use lowercase_with_underscores (e.g.,
  "note_explicit_target", "explicit_target").  If in doubt, use
  underscores.

- Use 'single quotes' for string literals, and """triple double
  quotes""" for docstrings.

.. _Style Guide for Python Code:
   http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html
.. _Docstring Conventions: http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0257.html


Copyrights and Licensing
------------------------

The majority of the Docutils project code and documentation has been
placed in the public domain.  Unless clearly and explicitly indicated
otherwise, any patches (modifications to existing files) submitted to
the project for inclusion (via SourceForge trackers, mailing lists, or
private email) are assumed to be in the public domain as well.

Any new files contributed to the project should clearly state their
intentions regarding copyright, in one of the following ways:

- Public domain (preferred): include the statement "This
  module/document has been placed in the public domain."

- Copyright & open source license: include a copyright notice, along
  with either an embedded license statement, a reference to an
  accompanying license file, or a license URL.

One of the goals of the Docutils project, once complete, is to be
incorporated into the Python standard library.  At that time copyright
of the Docutils code will be assumed by or transferred to the Python
Software Foundation (PSF), and will be released under Python's
license.  If the copyright/license option is chosen for new files, the
license should be compatible with Python's current license, and the
author(s) of the files should be willing to assign copyright to the
PSF.


CVS Check-ins
-------------

Instructions for CVS access can be found at
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=38414.  Anyone can access the CVS
repository anonymously.  Only project developers can make changes.

The `main source tree`_ ("docutils" CVS module) should always be kept
in a stable state (usable and as problem-free as possible).  The
Docutils project shall follow the `Python Check-in Policies`_ (as
applicable), with particular emphasis as follows:

- Before checking in any changes, run the entire Docutils test suite
  to be sure that you haven't broken anything.  From a shell::

      cd docutils/test
      alltests.py

- When adding new functionality (or fixing bugs), be sure to add test
  cases to the test suite.  Practise test-first programming; it's fun,
  it's addictive, and it works!

- The `sandbox CVS directory`_ is the place to put new, incomplete or
  experimental code.  See `Additions to Docutils`_ and `The Sandbox`_
  below.

- For bugs or omissions that have an obvious fix and can't possibly
  mess up anything else, go right ahead and check it in directly.

- For larger changes, use your best judgement.  If you're unsure of
  the impact, or feel that you require advice or approval, patches or
  `the sandbox`_ are the way to go.

Docutils will pursue an open and trusting policy for as long as
possible, and deal with any abberations if (and hopefully not when)
they happen.  I'd rather see a torrent of loose contributions than
just a trickle of perfect-as-they-stand changes.  The occasional
mistake is easy to fix.  That's what CVS is for.

Additions to Docutils
`````````````````````

Additions to the project, such as new components, should be developed
in the `sandbox CVS directory`_ until they're in `good shape`_,
usable_, and `reasonably complete`_.  Adding to the `main source
tree`_ implies a commitment to the Docutils user community.

- Why the sandbox?

  Developers should be able to try out new components while they're
  being developed for addition to main source tree.  See `The
  Sandbox`_ below.

- _`Good shape` means that the component code is clean, readable, and
  free of junk code (unused legacy code; by analogy with "junk DNA").

- _`Usable` means that the code does what it claims to do.  An "XYZ
  Writer" should produce reasonable XYZ.

- _`Reasonably complete` means that the code must handle all input.
  Here "handle" means that no input can cause the code to fail (cause
  an exception, or silently and incorrectly produce nothing).
  "Reasonably complete" does not mean "finished" (no work left to be
  done).  For example, a writer must handle every standard element
  from the Docutils document model; for unimplemented elements, it
  must *at the very least* warn that "Output for element X is not yet
  implemented in writer Y".

If you really want to check code into the main source tree, you can,
but you'll have to be prepared to work on it intensively and complete
it quickly.  People will start to use it and they will expect it to
work!  If there are any issues with your code, or if you only have
time for gradual development, you should put it in the sandbox first.
It's easy to move code over to the main source tree once it's closer
to completion.


Mailing Lists
-------------

Developers should subscribe to the mailing lists:

- The `Python Documentation Special Interest Group (Doc-SIG) mailing
  list`__ for high-level discussions on syntax, strategy, and design
  (email to Doc-SIG@python.org).
- Docutils-develop__, for implementation discussions
  (email to docutils-develop@lists.sourceforge.net).
- Docutils-checkins__, to monitor CVS checkin messages (automatically
  generated; normally read-only).

The Sandbox
-----------

The `sandbox CVS directory`_ is a place to play around, to try out and
share ideas.  It's a part of the CVS repository but it isn't
distributed as part of Docutils releases.  Feel free to check in code
to the CVS sandbox; that way people can try it out but you won't have
to worry about it working 100% error-free, as is the goal of the `main
source tree`_.  Each developer who wants to play in the sandbox should
create their own subdirectory (suggested name: SourceForge ID,
nickname, or given name + family initial).  It's OK to make a mess!
But please, play nice.

In order to minimize the work necessary for others to install and try
out new, experimental components, the following sandbox directory
structure is recommended::

    sandbox/
        userid/
            component_name/ # A verbose name is best.
                README.txt  # Please explain requirements,
                            # purpose/goals, and usage.
                docs/
                    ...
                component.py    # The component is a single module.
                            # *OR* (but *not* both)
                component/  # The component is a package.
                    __init__.py  # Contains the Reader/Writer class.
                    other1.py    # Other modules and data files used
                    data.txt     # by this component.
                    ...
                test/       # Test suite.
                    ...
                tools/      # For front ends etc.
                    ...
                setup.py    # Use Distutils to install the component
                            # code and tools/ files into the right
                            # places in Docutils.
