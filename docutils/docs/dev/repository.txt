Docutils uses a Subversion_ repository located at ``svn.berlios.de``.
Subversion is exhaustively documented in the `Subversion Book`_
(svnbook).

Accessing the Repository
========================

Anonymous Access
----------------

Anonymous (read-only) access is available at ``svn://svn.berlios.de/docutils/``.

To check out the current main source tree of Docutils, type ::

    svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/docutils/trunk/docutils

To check out everything (main tree, sandboxes, and web site), type ::

    svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/docutils/trunk docutils

This will create a working copy of the whole trunk in a new directory
called ``docutils``.

Note that you should *never* check out
``svn://svn.berlios.de/docutils`` (without "trunk"), because then
you'd end up fetching the whole Docutils tree for every branch and tag
over and over again, wasting your and BerliOS's bandwidth.

To update your working copy later on, cd into the working copy and
type ::

    svn update


Developer Access
----------------

If you are a developer, you get read-write access via
``svn+ssh://username@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/docutils/``, where
``username`` is your BerliOS user name.  So to retrieve a working
copy, type ::

    svn checkout svn+ssh://username@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/docutils/trunk docutils

If you previously had an anonymous working copy and gained developer
access, you can switch the URL associated with your working copy by
typing ::

    svn switch --relocate svn://svn.berlios.de/docutils/trunk/docutils \
        svn+ssh://username@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/docutils

(``username`` is again your BerliOS user name.)

Before commiting changes to the repository, please ensure that the
following lines are contained (and uncommented) in your
~/.subversion/config file, so that new files are added with the
correct properties set::

    [miscellany]
    # For your convenience:
    global-ignores = ... *.pyc ...
    # For correct properties:
    enable-auto-props = yes

    [auto-props]
    *.py = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id Revision
    *.txt = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id Revision
    *.sh = svn:eol-style=native;svn:executable;svn:keywords=Author Date Id Revision
    *.png = svn:mime-type=image/png


Web Access

Repository Layout
=================

The following tree shows the repository layout::

    docutils/
    |-- branches/
    |   |-- branch1/
    |   |   |-- docutils/
    |   |   |-- sandbox/
    |   |   `-- web/
    |   `-- branch2/
    |       |-- docutils/
    |       |-- sandbox/
    |       `-- web/
    |-- tags/
    |   |-- tag1/
    |   |   |-- docutils/
    |   |   |-- sandbox/
    |   |   `-- web/
    |   `-- tag2/
    |       |-- docutils/
    |       |-- sandbox/
    |       `-- web/
    `-- trunk/
        |-- docutils/
        |-- sandbox/
        `-- web/

``docutils/branches/`` and ``docutils/tags/`` contain (shallow) copies
of the whole trunk.

The main source tree lives at ``docutils/trunk/docutils/``, next to
the sandboxes (``docutils/trunk/sandbox/``) and the web site files
(``docutils/trunk/web/``).
