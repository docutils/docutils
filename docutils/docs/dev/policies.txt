Docutils is a meritocracy based on code contribution and lots of
discussion [#bcs]_.  A few quotes sum up the policies of the Docutils
project.  The IETF's classic credo (by MIT professor Dave Clark) is an
ideal we can aspire to:

    We reject: kings, presidents, and voting.  We believe in: rough
    consensus and running code.

As architect, chief cook and bottle-washer, I currently function as
BDFN (Benevolent Dictator For Now), but I would happily abdicate the
throne given a suitable candidate.  Any takers?

Eric S. Raymond, anthropologist of the hacker subculture, writes in
his essay `The Magic Cauldron`_:

    The number of contributors [to] projects is strongly and inversely
    correlated with the number of hoops each project makes a user go
    through to contribute.

    .. _The Magic Cauldron:
       http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/magic-cauldron/

Therefore, we will endeavour to keep the barrier to entry as low as
possible.  The policies below should not be thought of as barriers,
but merely as a codification of experience to date.  These are "best
practices", not absolutes; exceptions are expected, tolerated, and
used as a source of improvement.  Feedback and criticism is welcome.

As for control issues, Emmett Plant (CEO of the Xiph.org Foundation,
originators of Ogg Vorbis) put it well when he said:

    Open source dictates that you lose a certain amount of control
    over your codebase, and that's okay with us.

.. [#bcs] Phrase borrowed from `Ben Collins-Sussman of the Subversion
   project <http://www.red-bean.com/sussman/svn-anti-fud.html>`__.


Python Coding Conventions
=========================

These are the conventions I use in my own code.  Contributed code will
not be refused merely because it does not strictly adhere to these
conditions; as long as it's internally consistent, clean, and correct,
it probably will be accepted.  But don't be surprised if the
"offending" code gets fiddled over time to conform to these
conventions.

The Docutils project shall follow the generic coding conventions as
specified in the `Style Guide for Python Code`_ and `Docstring
Conventions`_ PEPs, with the following clarifications and extensions:

* 4 spaces per indentation level.  No tabs.

* Use only ASCII, no 8-bit strings.  See `Docutils
  Internationalization`_.

* No one-liner compound statements (i.e., no ``if x: return``: use two
  lines & indentation), except for degenerate class or method
  definitions (i.e., ``class X: pass`` is O.K.).

* Lines should be no more than 78 characters long.

* Use "StudlyCaps" for class names (except for element classes in
  docutils.nodes).

* Use "lowercase" or "lowercase_with_underscores" for function,
  method, and variable names.  For short names, maximum two words,
  joined lowercase may be used (e.g. "tagname").  For long names with
  three or more words, or where it's hard to parse the split between
  two words, use lowercase_with_underscores (e.g.,
  "note_explicit_target", "explicit_target").  If in doubt, use
  underscores.

* Avoid lambda expressions, which are inherently difficult to
  understand.  Named functions are preferable and superior: they're
  faster (no run-time compilation), and well-chosen names serve to
  document and aid understanding.

* Avoid functional constructs (filter, map, etc.).  Use list
  comprehensions instead.

* Avoid ``from __future__ import`` constructs.  They are inappropriate
  for production code.

* Use 'single quotes' for string literals, and """triple double
  quotes""" for docstrings.

.. _Style Guide for Python Code:
   http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html
.. _Docstring Conventions: http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0257.html
.. _Docutils Internationalization: ../howto/i18n.html#python-code


Documentation Conventions
=========================

* Docutils documentation is written using reStructuredText, of course.

* Use 7-bit ASCII if at all possible.

* Use the following section title adornment styles::

      ================
       Document Title
      ================

      ------------------------------
       Document Subtitle (optional)
      ------------------------------

      Section
      =======

      Subsection
      ----------

  If you need subsubsections and further, these characters are
  recommended for title underlines::

      ` .

* Use two blank lines before each section/subsection/etc. title.  One
  blank line is sufficient between immediately adjacent titles.

* Add a bibliographic field list immediately after the document
  title/subtitle.  See the beginning of this document for an example.

* Add an Emacs local variables block in a comment at the end of the
  document.  See the end of this document for an example.


Copyrights and Licensing
========================

The majority of the Docutils project code and documentation has been
placed in the public domain.  Unless clearly and explicitly indicated
otherwise, any patches (modifications to existing files) submitted to
the project for inclusion (via Subversion, SourceForge trackers,
mailing lists, or private email) are assumed to be in the public
domain as well.

Any new files contributed to the project should clearly state their
intentions regarding copyright, in one of the following ways:

* Public domain (preferred): include the statement "This
  module/document has been placed in the public domain."

* Copyright & open source license: include a copyright notice, along
  with either an embedded license statement, a reference to an
  accompanying license file, or a license URL.

One of the goals of the Docutils project, once complete, is to be
incorporated into the Python standard library.  At that time copyright
of the Docutils code will be assumed by or transferred to the Python
Software Foundation (PSF), and will be released under Python's
license.  If the copyright/license option is chosen for new files, the
license should be compatible with Python's current license, and the
author(s) of the files should be willing to assign copyright to the
PSF.


Subversion Check-ins
====================

Please see the `repository documentation`_ for details on how to
access Docutils' Subversion repository.  Anyone can access the
repository anonymously.  Only project developers can make changes.
Also see `Setting Up For Docutils Development`_ below for more info.

.. _repository documentation: repository.html

Unless you really *really* know what you're doing, please limit your
Subversion commands to ``svn checkout``, ``svn commit``, and ``svn
add``.  Do **NOT** use ``svn import`` unless you're absolutely sure
you know what you're doing.  Even then, grab a copy of the `nightly
repository tarball`_, set it up on your own machine, and experiment
*there* first (but remove hooks/post-commit first).

The `main source tree`_ ("trunk/docutils" directory) should always be
kept in a stable state (usable and as problem-free as possible).  The
Docutils project shall follow the `Python Check-in Policies`_ (as
applicable), with particular emphasis as follows:

* Before checking in any changes, run the entire Docutils test suite
  to be sure that you haven't broken anything.  From a shell::

      cd docutils/test
      ./alltests.py

  Docutils currently supports Python 2.1 [#py21]_ or later, with some
  things only working (and being tested) on Python 2.3+.  Therefore,
  you should actually have Pythons 2.1 [#py21]_, 2.2 and 2.3 installed
  and always run the tests on all of them.  (A good way to do that is
  to always run the test suite through a short script that runs
  ``alltests.py`` under each version of Python.)  If you can't afford
  intalling 3 Python versions, the edge cases (2.1 and 2.3) should
  cover most of it.

  .. [#py21] Python 2.1 may be used providing the compiler package is
     installed.  The compiler package can be found in the Tools/
     directory of Python 2.1's source distribution.

  Good resources covering the differences between Python versions:

  * `What's New in Python 2.2`__
  * `What's New in Python 2.3`__
  * `What's New in Python 2.4`__
  * `PEP 290 - Code Migration and Modernization`__

  __ http://www.python.org/doc/2.4.1/whatsnew/whatsnew24.html
  __ http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0290.html

* When adding new functionality (or fixing bugs), be sure to add test
  cases to the test suite.  Practise test-first programming; it's fun,
  it's addictive, and it works!

* The `sandbox directory`_ is the place to put new, incomplete or
  experimental code.  See `Additions to Docutils`_ and `The Sandbox`_
  below.

* For bugs or omissions that have an obvious fix and can't possibly
  mess up anything else, go right ahead and check it in directly.

* For larger changes, use your best judgement.  If you're unsure of
  the impact, or feel that you require advice or approval, patches or
  `the sandbox`_ are the way to go.

Docutils will pursue an open and trusting policy for as long as
possible, and deal with any aberrations if (and hopefully not when)
they happen.  I'd rather see a torrent of loose contributions than
just a trickle of perfect-as-they-stand changes.  The occasional
mistake is easy to fix.  That's what Subversion is for.

Additions to Docutils
---------------------

Additions to the project, such as new components, should be developed
in the `sandbox directory`_ until they're in `good shape`_, usable_,
documented_, and `reasonably complete`_.  Adding to the `main source
tree`_ or to a `parallel project`_ implies a commitment to the
Docutils user community.

* Why the sandbox?

  Developers should be able to try out new components while they're
  being developed for addition to main source tree.  See `The
  Sandbox`_ below.

* _`Good shape` means that the component code is clean, readable, and
  free of junk code (unused legacy code; by analogy with "junk DNA").

* _`Usable` means that the code does what it claims to do.  An "XYZ
  Writer" should produce reasonable XYZ.

* _`Documented`: The more the better.  The modules/files must be at
  least minimally documented internally.  `Docutils Front-End Tools`_
  should have a new section for any front-end tool that is added.
  `Docutils Configuration Files`_ should be modified with any
  settings/options defined.

* _`Reasonably complete` means that the code must handle all input.
  Here "handle" means that no input can cause the code to fail (cause
  an exception, or silently and incorrectly produce nothing).
  "Reasonably complete" does not mean "finished" (no work left to be
  done).  For example, a writer must handle every standard element
  from the Docutils document model; for unimplemented elements, it
  must *at the very least* warn that "Output for element X is not yet
  implemented in writer Y".

If you really want to check code into the main source tree, you can,
but you'll have to be prepared to work on it intensively and complete
it quickly.  People will start to use it and they will expect it to
work!  If there are any issues with your code, or if you only have
time for gradual development, you should put it in the sandbox first.
It's easy to move code over to the main source tree once it's closer
to completion.

Setting Up For Docutils Development
-----------------------------------

When making changes to the code, good developers always test their
changes.  That means running the code to check that it produces the
expected results, and running the test suite too.  The modified
Docutils code has to be accessible to Python for the tests to have any
meaning.  There are two ways to keep the Docutils code accessible:

* Update your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable so that Python picks
  up your local working copy of the code.  This is the recommended
  method.

  For the bash shell and Docutils checked out from Subversion in
  ``~/projects/docutils/``, add this to your ``~/.profile``::

      PYTHONPATH=$HOME/projects/docutils/docutils
      PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/projects/docutils/docutils/extras
      export PYTHONPATH

  The first line points to the directory containing the ``docutils``
  package.  The second line adds the directory containing the
  third-party modules Docutils depends on.  The third line exports
  this environment variable.  You may also wish to add the ``tools``
  directory to your ``PATH``::

      PATH=$PATH:$HOME/projects/docutils/docutils/tools

* Before you run anything, every time you make a change, reinstall
  Docutils::

      python setup.py install

  .. CAUTION::

     This method is **not** recommended for day-to-day development;
     it's too easy to forget.  Confusion inevitably ensues.

     If you install Docutils this way, Python will always pick up the
     last-installed copy of the code.  If you ever forget to reinstall
     the "docutils" package, Python won't see your latest changes.


Mailing Lists
=============

Developers are recommended to subscribe to all `mailing lists`_.

.. _mailing lists:: ../user/mailing-lists.html


The Sandbox
===========

The `sandbox directory`_ is a place to play around, to try out and
share ideas.  It's a part of the Subversion repository but it isn't
distributed as part of Docutils releases.  Feel free to check in code
to the sandbox; that way people can try it out but you won't have to
worry about it working 100% error-free, as is the goal of the `main
source tree`_.  Each developer who wants to play in the sandbox should
create either a project-specific subdirectory or personal subdirectory
(suggested name: SourceForge ID, nickname, or given name + family
initial).  It's OK to make a mess!  But please, play nice.

Please update the `sandbox README`_ file with links and a brief
description of your work.

In order to minimize the work necessary for others to install and try
out new, experimental components, the following sandbox directory
structure is recommended::

    sandbox/
        project_name/ # For a project where you invite contributions.
                      # Structure as in userid/component_name below.
        userid/       # For personal space.
            component_name/ # A verbose name is best.
                README.txt  # Please explain requirements,
                            # purpose/goals, and usage.
                docs/
                    ...
                component.py    # The component is a single module.
                            # *OR* (but *not* both)
                component/  # The component is a package.
                    __init__.py  # Contains the Reader/Writer class.
                    other1.py    # Other modules and data files used
                    data.txt     # by this component.
                    ...
                test/       # Test suite.
                    ...
                tools/      # For front ends etc.
                    ...
                setup.py    # Use Distutils to install the component
                            # code and tools/ files into the right
                            # places in Docutils.

Some sandbox projects are destined to become Docutils components once
completed.  Others, such as add-ons to Docutils or applications of
Docutils, graduate to become `parallel projects`_.

.. _sandbox README: http://docutils.sf.net/sandbox/README.html


.. _parallel project:

Parallel Projects
=================

Parallel projects contain useful code that is not central to the
functioning of Docutils.  Examples are specialized add-ons or
plug-ins, and applications of Docutils.  They use Docutils, but
Docutils does not require their presence to function.

An official parallel project will have its own directory beside (or
parallel to) the main ``docutils`` directory in the Subversion
repository.  It can have its own web page in the
docutils.sourceforge.net domain, its own file releases and
downloadable snapshots, and even a mailing list if that proves useful.
However, an official parallel project has implications: it is expected
to be maintained and continue to work with changes to the core
Docutils.

A parallel project requires a project leader, who must commit to
coordinate and maintain the implementation:

* Answer questions from users and developers.
* Review suggestions, bug reports, and patches.
* Monitor changes and ensure the quality of the code and
  documentation.
* Coordinate with Docutils to ensure interoperability.
* Put together official project releases.

Of course, related projects may be created independently of Docutils.
The advantage of a parallel project is that the SourceForge
environment and the developer and user communities are already
established.  Core Docutils developers are available for consultation
and may contribute to the parallel project.  It's easier to keep the
projects in sync when there are changes made to the core Docutils
code.
