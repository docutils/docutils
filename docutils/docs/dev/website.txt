===================
 Docutils Web Site
===================

:Author: David Goodger; open to all Docutils developers

The Docutils web site, <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>, is
maintained automatically by the ``docutils-update`` script, run as an
hourly cron job on shell.berlios.de (by user "wiemann").  The script
will process any .txt file which is newer than the corresponding .html
file in the project's web directory on shell.berlios.de
(``/home/groups/docutils/htdocs/aux/htdocs/``) and upload the changes
to the web site at SourceForge.

Please **do not** add any generated .html files to the Docutils
repository.  They will be generated automatically after a one-time
setup (`described below`__).

__ `Adding .txt Files`_

The docutils-update__ script is located at
``sandbox/infrastructure/docutils-update``.

__ http://docutils.sf.net/sandbox/infrastructure/docutils-update

If you want to share files via the web, you can upload them using the
uploaddocutils.sh__ script
(``sandbox/infrastructure/uploaddocutils.sh``).

Adding Directories
==================

After adding directories to SVN, allow the update script to run once
to create the directories in the filesystem before preparing for HTML
processing as described below.


Adding .txt Files
=================

For a new .txt file, just SSH to ``<username>@shell.berlios.de`` and
::

    cd /home/groups/docutils/htdocs/aux/htdocs/
    cd [path to your file's subdirectory]
    touch filename.html
    chmod g+w filename.html
    sleep 1
    touch filename.txt

The script will take care of the rest within an hour.  Thereafter
whenever the .txt file is modified (checked in to SVN), the .html will
be regenerated automatically.


Renoving Files & Directories
============================

Removing files and directories from SVN will not trigger their removal
from the web site.  Files and directories must be manually removed
from both berlios.de (under
``/home/groups/docutils/htdocs/aux/htdocs/``) and from sourceforge.net
(under ``/home/groups/d/do/docutils/htdocs/``).
