This document describes standard definition files, such as sets of
substitution definitions and interpreted text roles, that can be
included in reStructuredText documents.  The `"include" directive`__
has a special syntax for these standard definition files, angle
brackets around the file name::

    .. include:: <filename.txt>

__ directives.html#include

The individual data files are stored with the Docutils source code in
the "docutils" package, in the ``docutils/parsers/rst/include``
directory.


Substitution Definitions
========================

Many of the standard definition files contain sets of `substitution
definitions`__, which can be used in documents via `substitution
references`__.  For example, the copyright symbol is defined in
``isonum.txt`` as "copy"::

    .. include:: <isonum.txt>

    Copyright |copy| 2003 by John Q. Public, all rights reserved.

__ restructuredtext.html#substitution-definitions
__ restructuredtext.html#substitution-references

Individual substitution definitions can also be copied from definition
files and pasted into documents.  This has two advantages: it removes
dependencies, and it saves processing of unused definitions.  However,
multiple substitution definitions add clutter to the document.

Substitution references require separation from the surrounding text
with whitespace or punctuation.  To use a substitution without
intervening whitespace, you can use the disappearing-whitespace escape
sequence, backslash-space::

    .. include:: <isonum.txt>

    Copyright |copy| 2003, BogusMegaCorp\ |trade|.

Custom substitution definitions may use the `"unicode" directive`__.
Whitespace is ignored and removed, effectively sqeezing together the
text::

    .. |copy|   unicode:: U+000A9 .. COPYRIGHT SIGN
    .. |BogusMegaCorp (TM)| unicode:: BogusMegaCorp U+2122
       .. with trademark sign

    Copyright |copy| 2003, |BogusMegaCorp (TM)|.

__ directives.html#unicode

In addition, the "ltrim", "rtrim", and "trim" options may be used with
the "unicode" directive to automatically trim spaces from the left,
right, or both sides (respectively) of substitution references::

    .. |---| unicode:: U+02014 .. em dash
       :trim:


Character Entity Sets
---------------------

The following files contain substitution definitions corresponding to
XML character entity sets, from the following standards: ISO 8879 &
ISO 9573-13 (combined), MathML, and XHTML1.  They were generated by
the ``tools/dev/unicode2rstsubs.py`` program from the input file
unicode.xml__, which is maintained as part of the MathML 2
Recommentation XML source.

.. [1] There are ``*-wide.txt`` variants for each of these character
   entity set files, containing characters outside of the Unicode
   basic multilingual plane or BMP (wide-Unicode; code points greater
   than U+FFFF).  Before Python 3.3, some distributions were "narrow"
   and did not support wide-Unicode characters. This should not be an
   issue nowadays.

For example, the copyright symbol is defined as the XML character
entity ``&copy;``.  The equivalent reStructuredText substitution
reference (defined in both ``isonum.txt`` and ``xhtml1-lat1.txt``) is
``|copy|``.

Role Definitions
================

Role definitions use the `"role" directive`_ to provide additional
`reStructuredText interpreted text roles`_.

.. _"role" directive: directives.html#role
.. _reStructuredText interpreted text roles: roles.html


Additional roles for HTML
-------------------------

The "html-roles.txt_" standard definitions file provides role
definitions for semantic `HTML inline markup elements`__ and
`tags for representation of edits to the document`__ that
do not have a corresponding standard rST role
(except for elements requiring an additional attribute).

The additional roles work out of the box with the `"html5" writer`_
that selects the corresponding HTML element.
LaTeX styling definitions are included. For best results add
the LaTeX packages soul_ and xcolor_ to the `stylesheet setting`__.

.. _html-roles.txt: ../../../docutils/parsers/rst/include/html-roles.txt
__ https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html
__ https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/edits.html
__ ../../user/config.html#stylesheet-2
.. _soul: https://ctan.org/pkg/soul
.. _xcolor: https://ctan.org/pkg/xcolor

.. class:: field-indent-4em

:b:    highlight :b:`key words` without marking them up as important
:bdi:  text :bdi:`directionality` isolation [#attribute-optional]_
:del:  :del:`represents` removed content [#attribute-optional]_
:dfn:  :dfn:`dfn` represents the defining instance of a term
       [#attribute-optional]_
:i:    :i:`voix alternative`
:ins:  :ins:`editional` additions [#attribute-optional]_
:kbd:  user input like :kbd:`Ctrl X`
:mark: :mark:`highlight` a run of text
:q:    represents :q:`phrasing content quoted from another source`
       [#attribute-optional]_
:s:    text that is no longer accurate, :s:`or no longer relevant`
:samp: computer output like :samp:`hello world!`
:small: side comments :small:`like this`
:u:    unarticulated annotations of, e.g, :u:`mispellings`
:var:  variables (or constants like :var:`c`)

.. [#attribute-optional] Would gain from support for attributes/arguments
   to inline roles (see TODO_).

S5/HTML Definitions
-------------------

The "s5defs.txt_" standard definition file contains interpreted text
roles (classes) and other definitions for documents destined to become
`S5/HTML slide shows`_.

.. _s5defs.txt: ../../../docutils/parsers/rst/include/s5defs.txt
.. _S5/HTML slide shows: ../../user/slide-shows.html
