This document describes the directives implemented in the reference
reStructuredText parser.

Directives have the following syntax::

    +-------+-------------------------------+
    | ".. " | directive type "::" directive |
    +-------+ block                         |
            |                               |
            +-------------------------------+

Directives begin with an explicit markup start (two periods and a
space), followed by the directive type and two colons (collectively,
the "directive marker").  The directive block begins immediately after
the directive marker, and includes all subsequent indented lines.  The
directive block is divided into arguments, options (a field list), and
content (in that order), any of which may appear.  See the Directives_
section in the `reStructuredText Markup Specification`_ for syntax
details.

Descriptions below list "doctree elements" (document tree element
names; XML DTD generic identifiers) corresponding to individual
directives.  For details on the hierarchy of elements, please see `The
Docutils Document Tree`_ and the `Docutils Generic DTD`_ XML document
type definition.  For directive implementation details, see `Creating
reStructuredText Directives`_.

.. _warning:

Specific Admonitions
====================

:Directive Types: "attention", "caution", "danger", "error", "hint",
                  "important", "note", "tip", "warning", "admonition"
:Doctree Elements: attention, caution, danger, error, hint, important,
                   note, tip, warning, admonition, title
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: None.
:Directive Content: Interpreted as body elements.

Admonitions are specially marked "topics" that can appear anywhere an
ordinary body element can.  They contain arbitrary body elements.
Typically, an admonition is rendered as an offset block in a document,
sometimes outlined or shaded, with a title matching the admonition
type.  For example::

    .. DANGER::
       Beware killer rabbits!

This directive might be rendered something like this::

    +------------------------+
    |        !DANGER!        |
    |                        |
    | Beware killer rabbits! |
    +------------------------+

The following admonition directives have been implemented:

- attention
- caution
- danger
- error
- hint
- important
- note
- tip
- warning

Any text immediately following the directive indicator (on the same
line and/or indented on following lines) is interpreted as a directive
block and is parsed for normal body elements.  For example, the
following "note" admonition directive contains one paragraph and a
bullet list consisting of two list items::

    .. note:: This is a note admonition.
       This is the second line of the first paragraph.

       - The note contains all indented body elements
         following.
       - It includes this bullet list.


.. _admonition:

Generic Admonition
==================

:Directive Type: "admonition"
:Doctree Elements: admonition, title
:Directive Arguments: One, required (admonition title)
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: Interpreted as body elements.

This is a generic, titled admonition.  The title may be anything the
author desires.

The author-supplied title is also used as a "class" attribute value
after being converted into a valid identifier form (down-cased;
non-alphanumeric characters converted to single hyphens; "admonition-"
prefixed).  For example, this admonition::

    .. admonition:: And, by the way...

       You can make up your own admonition too.

becomes the following document tree (pseudo-XML)::

    <document source="test data">
        <admonition class="admonition-and-by-the-way">
            <title>
                And, by the way...
            <paragraph>
                You can make up your own admonition too.

The following option is recognized:

``class`` : text
    Override the computed "class" attribute value.  See the class_
    directive below.


--------
 Images
--------

There are two image directives: "image" and "figure".


Image
=====

:Directive Type: "image"
:Doctree Element: image
:Directive Arguments: One, required (image URI).
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: None.

An "image" is a simple picture::

    .. image:: picture.png

The URI for the image source file is specified in the directive
argument.  As with hyperlink targets, the image URI may begin on the
same line as the explicit markup start and target name, or it may
begin in an indented text block immediately following, with no
intervening blank lines.  If there are multiple lines in the link
block, they are stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and joined
together.

Optionally, the image link block may contain a flat field list, the
_`image options`.  For example::

    .. image:: picture.jpeg
       :height: 100
       :width: 200
       :scale: 50
       :alt: alternate text
       :align: right

The following options are recognized:

``alt`` : text
    Alternate text: a short description of the image, displayed by
    applications that cannot display images, or spoken by applications
    for visually impaired users.

``height`` : integer
    The desired height of the image in pixels, used to reserve space
    or scale the image vertically.  When the "scale" option is also
    specified, they are combined.  For example, a height of 200 and a
    scale of 50 is equivalent to a height of 100 with no scale.

``width`` : integer
    The width of the image in pixels, used to reserve space or scale
    the image horizontally.  As with "height" above, when the "scale"
    option is also specified, they are combined.

``scale`` : integer
    The uniform scaling factor of the image, a percentage (but no "%"
    symbol is required or allowed).  "100" means full-size, and is
    equivalent to omitting a "scale" option.

    If no "height" or "width" options are specified, PIL [#PIL]_ may
    be used to determine them, if PIL is installed and the image file
    is available.

``align`` : "top", "middle", "bottom", "left", "center", or "right"
    The alignment of the image, equivalent to the HTML ``<img>`` tag's
    "align" attribute.  The values "top", "middle", and "bottom"
    control an image's vertical alignment (relative to the text
    baseline); they are only useful for inline images (substitutions).
    The values "left", "center", and "right" control an image's
    horizontal alignment, allowing the image to float and have the
    text flow around it.  The specific behavior depends upon the
    browser or rendering software used.

``target`` : text (URI or reference name)
    Makes the image into a hyperlink reference ("clickable").  The
    option argument may be a URI (relative or absolute), or a
    reference name with underscore suffix (e.g. ``name_``).

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the image element.  See the
    class_ directive below.


Figure
======

:Directive Type: "figure"
:Doctree Elements: figure, image, caption, legend
:Directive Arguments: One, required (image URI).
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: Interpreted as the figure caption and an optional
                    legend.

A "figure" consists of image_ data (including `image options`_), an
optional caption (a single paragraph), and an optional legend
(arbitrary body elements)::

    .. figure:: picture.png
       :scale: 50
       :alt: map to buried treasure

       This is the caption of the figure (a simple paragraph).

       The legend consists of all elements after the caption.  In this
       case, the legend consists of this paragraph and the following
       table:

       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | Symbol                | Meaning               |
       +=======================+=======================+
       | .. image:: tent.png   | Campground            |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | .. image:: waves.png  | Lake                  |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | .. image:: peak.png   | Mountain              |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+

There must be blank lines before the caption paragraph and before the
legend.  To specify a legend without a caption, use an empty comment
("..") in place of the caption.

The "figure" directive supports all of the options of the "image"
directive (see `image options`_ above).  In addition, the following
options are recognized:

``figwidth`` : integer or "image"
    The width of the figure in pixels, to limit the horizontal space
    used.  A special value of "image" is allowed, in which case the
    included image's actual width is used (requires PIL [#PIL]_).  If
    the image file is not found or the required software is
    unavailable, this option is ignored.

    Sets the "width" attribute of the "figure" doctree element.

    This option does not scale the included image; use the "width"
    `image`_ option for that. ::

        +---------------------------+
        |        figure             |
        |                           |
        |<------ figwidth --------->|
        |                           |
        |  +---------------------+  |
        |  |     image           |  |
        |  |                     |  |
        |  |<--- width --------->|  |
        |  +---------------------+  |
        |                           |
        |The figure's caption should|
        |wrap at this width.        |
        +---------------------------+

``figclass`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the figure element.  See the
    class_ directive below.

 Body Elements
---------------

Topic
=====

:Directive Type: "topic"
:Doctree Element: topic
:Directive Arguments: 1, required (topic title).
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: Interpreted as the topic body.

A topic is like a block quote with a title, or a self-contained
section with no subsections.  Use the "topic" directive to indicate a
self-contained idea that is separate from the flow of the document.
Topics may occur anywhere a section or transition may occur.  Body
elements (including topics) may not contain nested topics.

The directive's sole argument is interpreted as the topic title; the
next line must be blank.  All subsequent lines make up the topic body,
interpreted as body elements.  For example::

    .. topic:: Topic Title

        Subsequent indented lines comprise
        the body of the topic, and are
        interpreted as body elements.

The following option is recognized:

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the topic element.  See the
    class_ directive below.


Sidebar
=======

:Directive Type: "sidebar"
:Doctree Element: sidebar
:Directive Arguments: One, required (sidebar title).
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: Interpreted as the sidebar body.

Sidebars are like miniature, parallel documents that occur inside
other documents, providing related or reference material.  A sidebar
is typically offset by a border and "floats" to the side of the page;
the document's main text may flow around it.  Sidebars can also be
likened to super-footnotes; their content is outside of the flow of
the document's main text.

Sidebars may occur anywhere a section or transition may occur.  Body
elements (including sidebars) may not contain nested sidebars.

The directive's sole argument is interpreted as the sidebar title,
which may be followed by a subtitle option (see below); the next line
must be blank.  All subsequent lines make up the sidebar body,
interpreted as body elements.  For example::

    .. sidebar:: Sidebar Title
       :subtitle: Optional Sidebar Subtitle

       Subsequent indented lines comprise
       the body of the sidebar, and are
       interpreted as body elements.

The following options are recognized:

``subtitle`` : text
    The sidebar's subtitle.

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the sidebar element.  See the
    class_ directive below.


Line Block
==========

:Directive Type: "line-block"
:Doctree Element: line_block
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: Becomes the body of the line block.

The "line-block" directive constructs an element where whitespace
(including linebreaks) is significant and inline markup is supported.
It is equivalent to a `parsed literal block`_ with different
rendering: typically in an ordinary serif typeface instead of a
typewriter/monospaced face, and not automatically indented.  (Have the
line-block directive begin a block quote to get an indented line
block.)  Line blocks are useful for address blocks and verse (poetry,
song lyrics), where the structure of lines is significant.  For
example, here's a classic::

    "To Ma Own Beloved Lassie: A Poem on her 17th Birthday", by
    Ewan McTeagle (for Lassie O'Shea):

        .. line-block::

            Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday.
            I'm absolutely skint.
            But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back
                as soon as it comes.
            Love, Ewan.

The following option is recognized:

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the line_block element.  See the
    class_ directive below.


.. _parsed-literal:

Parsed Literal Block
====================

:Directive Type: "parsed-literal"
:Doctree Element: literal_block
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: Becomes the body of the literal block.

Unlike an ordinary literal block, the "parsed-literal" directive
constructs a literal block where the text is parsed for inline markup.
It is equivalent to a `line block`_ with different rendering:
typically in a typewriter/monospaced typeface, like an ordinary
literal block.  Parsed literal blocks are useful for adding hyperlinks
to code examples.

However, care must be taken with the text, because inline markup is
recognized and there is no protection from parsing.  Backslash-escapes
may be necessary to prevent unintended parsing.  And because the
markup characters are removed by the parser, care must also be taken
with vertical alignment.  Parsed "ASCII art" is tricky, and extra
whitespace may be necessary.

For example, all the element names in this content model are links::

    .. parsed-literal::

        ((title_,
          subtitle_?)?,
         docinfo_?,
         decoration_?,
         `%structure.model;`_)

The following option is recognized:

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the literal_block element.  See
    the class_ directive below.


Rubric
======

:Directive Type: "rubric"
:Doctree Element: rubric
:Directive Arguments: 1, required (rubric text).
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: None.

     rubric n. 1. a title, heading, or the like, in a manuscript,
     book, statute, etc., written or printed in red or otherwise
     distinguished from the rest of the text. ...

     -- Random House Webster's College Dictionary, 1991

The "rubric" directive inserts a "rubric" element into the document
tree.  A rubric is like an informal heading that doesn't correspond to
the document's structure.

The following option is recognized:

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the rubric element.  See the
    class_ directive below.


Epigraph
========

:Directive Type: "epigraph"
:Doctree Element: block_quote
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: None.
:Directive Content: Interpreted as the body of the block quote.

Produces an epigraph-class block quote.  For example, this input::

     .. epigraph::

        No matter where you go, there you are.

        -- Buckaroo Banzai

becomes this document tree fragment::

    <block_quote class="epigraph">
        <paragraph>
            No matter where you go, there you are.
        <attribution>
            Buckaroo Banzai


Highlights
==========

:Directive Type: "highlights"
:Doctree Element: block_quote
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: None.
:Directive Content: Interpreted as the body of the block quote.

Produces a highlights-class block quote.  See Epigraph_ above.


Pull-Quote
==========

:Directive Type: "pull-quote"
:Doctree Element: block_quote
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: None.
:Directive Content: Interpreted as the body of the block quote.

Produces a pull-quote-class block quote.  See Epigraph_ above.


--------
 Tables
--------

Formal tables need more structure than the reStructuredText syntax
supplies.  Tables may be given titles with the table_ directive.
Sometimes reStructuredText tables are inconvenient to write, or table
data in a standard format is readily available.  The csv-table_
directive supports CSV data.


Table
=====

:Directive Type: "table"
:Doctree Element: table
:Directive Arguments: 1, optional (table title).
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: A normal reStructuredText table.

(New in Docutils 0.3.1)

The "table" directive is used to create a titled table, to associate a
title with a table::

    .. table:: Truth table for "not"

       =====  =====
         A    not A
       =====  =====
       False  True
       True   False
       =====  =====

The following option is recognized:

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the table element.  See the
    class_ directive below.


.. _csv-table:

CSV Table
=========

:Directive Type: "csv-table"
:Doctree Element: table
:Directive Arguments: 1, optional (table title).
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: A CSV (comma-separated values) table.

.. Warning::

   The "csv-table" directive requires the ``csv.py`` module of the
   Python standard library, which was added in Python 2.3.  It will
   not work with earlier versions of Python.  Using the "csv-table"
   directive in a document will make the document **incompatible**
   with systems using Python 2.1 or 2.2.

(New in Docutils 0.3.4)

The "csv-table" directive is used to create a table from CSV
(comma-separated values) data.  CSV is a common data format generated
by spreadsheet applications and commercial databases.  The data may be
internal (an integral part of the document) or external (a separate
file).

Example::

    .. csv-table:: Frozen Delights!
       :header: "Treat", "Quantity", "Description"
       :widths: 15, 10, 30

       "Albatross", 2.99, "On a stick!"
       "Crunchy Frog", 1.49, "If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be
       crunchy, now would it?"
       "Gannet Ripple", 1.99, "On a stick!"

Block markup and inline markup within cells is supported.  Line ends
are recognized within cells.

Working limitations:

* Whitespace delimiters are supported only for external CSV files.

* There is no support for checking that the number of columns in each
  row is the same.  However, this directive supports CSV generators
  that do not insert "empty" entries at the end of short rows, by
  automatically adding empty entries.

  .. Add "strict" option to verify input?

* Due to limitations of the CSV parser, this directive is not Unicode
  compatible.  It may also have problems with ASCII NUL characters.
  Accordingly, CSV tables should be ASCII-printable safe.

  .. Test with Unicode; see if that's really so.  "encoding" option?

The following options are recognized:

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the table element.  See the
    class_ directive below.

``widths`` : integer [, integer...]
    A comma-separated list of relative column widths.  The default is
    equal-width columns (100%/#columns).

``header-rows`` : integer
    The number of rows of CSV data to use in the table header.
    Defaults to 0.

``header`` : CSV data
    Supplemental data for the table header, added independently of and
    before any ``header-rows`` from the main CSV data.  Must use the
    same CSV format as the main CSV data.

``file`` | ``url`` : path
    Path or URL to CSV file.

``delim`` : char | "tab" | "space"
    A one-character string used to separate fields.  Defaults to ``,``
    (comma).  May be specified as a Unicode code point; see the
    unicode_ directive for syntax details.

``quote`` : char
    A one-character string used to quote elements containing the
    delimiter or which start with the quote character.  Defaults to
    ``"`` (quote).  May be specified as a Unicode code point; see the
    unicode_ directive for syntax details.

``keepspace`` : flag
    Treat whitespace immediately following the delimiter as
    significant.  The default is to ignore such whitespace.

``escape`` : char
    A one-character string used to escape the delimiter or quote
    characters.  May be specified as a Unicode code point; see the
    unicode_ directive for syntax details.  Used when the delimiter is
    used in an unquoted field, or when quote characters are used
    within a field.  The default is to double-up the character,
    e.g. "He said, ""Hi!"""

    .. Add another possible value, "double", to explicitly indicate
       the default case?

 Document Parts
----------------

.. _contents:

Table of Contents
=================

:Directive Type: "contents"
:Doctree Elements: pending, topic
:Directive Arguments: One, optional: title.
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: None.

The "contents" directive inserts a table of contents (TOC) in two
passes: initial parse and transform.  During the initial parse, a
"pending" element is generated which acts as a placeholder, storing
the TOC title and any options internally.  At a later stage in the
processing, the "pending" element is replaced by a "topic" element, a
title and the table of contents proper.

The directive in its simplest form::

    .. contents::

Language-dependent boilerplate text will be used for the title.  The
English default title text is "Contents".

An explicit title, may be specified::

    .. contents:: Table of Contents

The title may span lines, although it is not recommended::

    .. contents:: Here's a very long Table of
       Contents title

Options may be specified for the directive, using a field list::

    .. contents:: Table of Contents
       :depth: 2

If the default title is to be used, the options field list may begin
on the same line as the directive marker::

    .. contents:: :depth: 2

The following options are recognized:

``depth`` : integer
    The number of section levels that are collected in the table of
    contents.  The default is unlimited depth.

``local`` : flag (empty)
    Generate a local table of contents.  Entries will only include
    subsections of the section in which the directive is given.  If no
    explicit title is given, the table of contents will not be titled.

``backlinks`` : "entry" or "top" or "none"
    Generate links from section headers back to the table of contents
    entries, the table of contents itself, or generate no backlinks.

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the topic element.  See the
    class_ directive below.


.. _sectnum:
.. _section-autonumbering:

Automatic Section Numbering
===========================

:Directive Type: "sectnum" or "section-autonumbering" (synonyms)
:Doctree Elements: pending, generated
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: None.

The "sectnum" (or "section-autonumbering") directive automatically
numbers sections and subsections in a document.  Section numbers are
of the "multiple enumeration" form, where each level has a number,
separated by periods.  For example, the title of section 1, subsection
2, subsubsection 3 would have "1.2.3" prefixed.

The "sectnum" directive does its work in two passes: the initial parse
and a transform.  During the initial parse, a "pending" element is
generated which acts as a placeholder, storing any options internally.
At a later stage in the processing, the "pending" element triggers a
transform, which adds section numbers to titles.  Section numbers are
enclosed in a "generated" element, and titles have their "auto"
attribute set to "1".

The following options are recognized:

``depth`` : integer
    The number of section levels that are numbered by this directive.
    The default is unlimited depth.

``prefix`` : string
    An arbitrary string that is prefixed to the automatically
    generated section numbers.  It may be something like "3.2.", which
    will produce "3.2.1", "3.2.2", "3.2.2.1", and so on.  Note that
    any separating punctuation (in the example, a period, ".") must be
    explicitly provided.  The default is no prefix.

``suffix`` : string
    An arbitrary string that is appended to the automatically
    generated section numbers.  The default is no suffix.

``start`` : integer
    The value that will be used for the first section number.
    Combined with ``prefix``, this may be used to force the right
    numbering for a document split over several source files.  The
    default is 1.

.. _target-notes:

Target Footnotes
================

:Directive Type: "target-notes"
:Doctree Elements: pending, footnote, footnote_reference
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: None.
:Directive Content: None.

The "target-notes" directive creates a footnote for each external
target in the text, and corresponding footnote references after each
reference.  For every explicit target (of the form, ``.. _target name:
URL``) in the text, a footnote will be generated containing the
visible URL as content.


Footnotes

Meta
====

:Directive Type: "meta"
:Doctree Element: meta (non-standard)
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: None.
:Directive Content: Must contain a flat field list.

The "meta" directive is used to specify HTML metadata stored in HTML
META tags.  "Metadata" is data about data, in this case data about web
pages.  Metadata is used to describe and classify web pages in the
World Wide Web, in a form that is easy for search engines to extract
and collate.

Within the directive block, a flat field list provides the syntax for
metadata.  The field name becomes the contents of the "name" attribute
of the META tag, and the field body (interpreted as a single string
without inline markup) becomes the contents of the "content"
attribute.  For example::

    .. meta::
       :description: The reStructuredText plaintext markup language
       :keywords: plaintext, markup language

This would be converted to the following HTML::

    <meta name="description"
        content="The reStructuredText plaintext markup language">
    <meta name="keywords" content="plaintext, markup language">

Support for other META attributes ("http-equiv", "scheme", "lang",
"dir") are provided through field arguments, which must be of the form
"attr=value"::

    .. meta::
       :description lang=en: An amusing story
       :description lang=fr: Un histoire amusant

And their HTML equivalents::

    <meta name="description" lang="en" content="An amusing story">
    <meta name="description" lang="fr" content="Un histoire amusant">

Some META tags use an "http-equiv" attribute instead of the "name"
attribute.  To specify "http-equiv" META tags, simply omit the name::

    .. meta::
       :http-equiv=Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

HTML equivalent::

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
         content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">

.. _include:

Including an External Document Fragment
=======================================

:Directive Type: "include"
:Doctree Elements: depend on data being included
:Directive Arguments: One, required.
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: None.

The "include" directive reads a reStructuredText-formatted text file
and parses it in the current document's context at the point of the
directive.  The directive argument is the path to the file to be
included, relative to the document containing the directive.  For
example::

    This first example will be parsed at the document level, and can
    thus contain any construct, including section headers.

    .. include:: inclusion.txt

    Back in the main document.

        This second example will be parsed in a block quote context.
        Therefore it may only contain body elements.  It may not
        contain section headers.

        .. include:: inclusion.txt

If an included document fragment contains section structure, the title
adornments must match those of the master document.

The text encoding of the master input source is used for included
files.

The following options are recognized:

``literal`` : flag (empty)
    The entire included text is inserted into the document as a single
    literal block (useful for program listings).


.. _raw:

Raw Data Pass-Through
=====================

:Directive Type: "raw"
:Doctree Element: raw
:Directive Arguments: One, required (output format type).
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: Stored verbatim, uninterpreted.  None (empty) if a
                    "file" or "url" option given.

The "raw" directive indicates non-reStructuredText data that is to be
passed untouched to the Writer.  The name of the output format is
given in the first argument.  The interpretation of the raw data is up
to the Writer.  A Writer may ignore any raw output not matching its
format.

For example, the following input would be passed untouched by an HTML
Writer::

    .. raw:: html

       <hr width=50 size=10>

A LaTeX Writer could insert the following raw content into its
output stream::

    .. raw:: latex

       \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}

Raw data can also be read from an external file, specified in a
directive option.  In this case, the content block must be empty.  For
example::

    .. raw:: html
       :file: inclusion.html

The following options are recognized:

``file`` : string
    The local filesystem path of a raw data file to be included.
``url`` : string
    An Internet URL reference to a raw data file to be included.


.. _replace:

Replacement Text
================

:Directive Type: "replace"
:Doctree Element: Text & inline elements
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: None.
:Directive Content: A single paragraph; may contain inline markup.

The "replace" directive is used to indicate replacement text for a
substitution reference.  It may be used within substitution
definitions only.  For example, this directive can be used to expand
abbreviations::

    .. |reST| replace:: reStructuredText

    Yes, |reST| is a long word, so I can't blame anyone for wanting to
    abbreviate it.

As reStructuredText doesn't support nested inline markup, the only way
to create a reference with styled text is to use substitutions with
the "replace" directive::

    I recommend you try |Python|_.

    .. |Python| replace:: Python, *the* best language around
    .. _Python: http://www.python.org/


.. _unicode:

Unicode Character Codes
=======================

:Directive Type: "unicode"
:Doctree Element: Text
:Directive Arguments: One or more, required (Unicode character codes,
                      optional text, and comments).
:Directive Options: None.
:Directive Content: None.

The "unicode" directive converts Unicode character codes (numerical
values) to characters, and may be used in substitution definitions
only.

The arguments, separated by spaces, can be:

* **character codes** as

  - decimal numbers or

  - hexadecimal numbers, prefixed by ``0x``, ``x``, ``\x``, ``U+``,
    ``u``, or ``\u`` or as XML-style hexadecimal character entities,
    e.g. ``&#x1a2b;``

* **text**, which is used as-is.

Text following " .. " is a comment and is ignored.  The spaces between
the arguments are ignored and thus do not appear in the output.
Hexadecimal codes are case-insensitive.

For example, the following text::

    Copyright |copy| 2003, |BogusMegaCorp (TM)|.

    .. |copy| unicode:: 0xA9 .. copyright sign
    .. |BogusMegaCorp (TM)| unicode:: BogusMegaCorp U+2122
       .. with trademark sign

results in:

    Copyright |copy| 2003, |BogusMegaCorp (TM)|.

    .. |copy| unicode:: 0xA9 .. copyright sign
    .. |BogusMegaCorp (TM)| unicode:: BogusMegaCorp U+2122
       .. with trademark sign


Class
=====

:Directive Type: "class"
:Doctree Element: pending
:Directive Arguments: One, required (class name / attribute value).
:Directive Options: None.
:Directive Content: None.

The "class" directive sets a "class" attribute value on the first
immediately following non-comment element [#]_.  For details of the
"class" attribute, see `its entry`__ in `The Docutils Document Tree`_.
The "class" attribute value is converted to lowercase and all
non-alphanumeric characters are converted to hyphens in order to match
this regular expression: ``[a-z](-?[a-z0-9]+)*``.  See the docstring
from ``docutils.nodes.make_id`` for the rationale.

Examples::

    .. class:: special

    This is a "special" paragraph.

    .. class:: exceptional

    An Exceptional Section
    ======================

    This is an ordinary paragraph.

The text above is parsed and transformed into this doctree fragment::

    <paragraph class="special">
        This is a "special" paragraph.
    <section class="exceptional">
        <title>
            An Exceptional Section
        <paragraph>
            This is an ordinary paragraph.

.. [#] To set a "class" attribute value on a block quote, the "class"
   directive must be followed by an empty comment::

       .. class:: highlights
       ..

           Block quote text.

   The directive doesn't allow content, therefore an empty comment is
   required to terminate the directive.  Without the empty comment,
   the block quote text would be interpreted as the "class"
   directive's content, and the parser would complain.

.. _role:

Custom Interpreted Text Roles
=============================

:Directive Type: "role"
:Doctree Element: None; affects subsequent parsing.
:Directive Arguments: Two; one required (role name), one optional
                      (base role name, in parentheses).
:Directive Options: Possible (depends on base role).
:Directive Content: depends on base role.

(New in Docutils 0.3.2)

The "role" directive dynamically creates a custom interpreted text
role and registers it with the parser.  This means that after
declaring a role like this::

    .. role:: custom

the document may use the new "custom" role::

    An example of using :custom:`interpreted text`

This will be parsed into the following document tree fragment::

    <paragraph>
        An example of using
        <inline class="custom">
            interpreted text

The role must be declared in a document before it can be used.

The new role may be based on an existing role, specified as a second
argument in parentheses (whitespace optional)::

    .. role:: custom(emphasis)

    :custom:`text`

The parsed result is as follows::

    <paragraph>
        <emphasis class="custom">
            text

If no base role is explicitly specified, a generic custom role is
automatically used.  Subsequent interpreted text will produce an
"inline" element with a "class" attribute, as in the first example
above.

With most roles, the ":class:" option can be used to set a "class"
attribute that is different from the role name.  For example::

    .. role:: custom
       :class: special

    :custom:`interpreted text`

This is the parsed result::

    <paragraph>
        <inline class="special">
            interpreted text

.. _role class:

The following option is recognized by the "role" directive for most
base roles:

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the element produced (``inline``,
    or element associated with a base class) when the custom
    interpreted text role is used.  If no directive options are
    specified, a "class" option with the directive argument (role
    name) as the value is implied.  See the class_ directive above.

Specific roles may support other options and/or directive content.
See the `reStructuredText Interpreted Text Roles`_ document for
details.

Restructuredtext-Test-Directive
===============================

:Directive Type: "restructuredtext-test-directive"
:Doctree Element: system_warning
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: None.
:Directive Content: Interpreted as a literal block.

This directive is provided for test purposes only.  (Nobody is
expected to type in a name *that* long!)  It is converted into a
level-1 (info) system message showing the directive data, possibly
followed by a literal block containing the rest of the directive
block.
