This document describes the directives implemented in the reference
reStructuredText parser.

Directives have the following syntax::

    +-------+--------------------------+
    | ".. " | directive type "::" data |
    +-------+ directive block          |
            |                          |
            +--------------------------+

Directives begin with an explicit markup start (two periods and a
space), followed by the directive type, two colons, optional directive
data (on the same line as the directive type) and an optional
directive block (on subsequent lines).  The directive block is
indented, aligned with the left edge of the directive type.


.. contents::


-------------
 Admonitions
-------------

DTD elements: attention, caution, danger, error, hint, important,
note, tip, warning.

Directive block: directive data and all following indented text
are interpreted as body elements.

Admonitions are specially marked "topics" that can appear anywhere an
ordinary body element can.  They contain arbitrary body elements.
Typically, an admonition is rendered as an offset block in a document,
sometimes outlined or shaded, with a title matching the admonition
type.  For example::

    .. DANGER::
       Beware killer rabbits!

This directive might be rendered something like this::

    +------------------------+
    |        !DANGER!        |
    |                        |
    | Beware killer rabbits! |
    +------------------------+

The following admonition directives have been implemented:

- attention
- caution
- danger
- error
- hint
- important
- note
- tip
- warning

Any text immediately following the directive indicator (on the same
line and/or indented on following lines) is interpreted as a directive
block and is parsed for normal body elements.  For example, the
following "note" admonition directive contains one paragraph and a
bullet list consisting of two list items::

    .. note:: This is a note admonition.
       This is the second line of the first paragraph.

       - The note contains all indented body elements
         following.
       - It includes this bullet list.


--------
 Images
--------

There are two image directives: "image" and "figure".


Image
=====

DTD element: image.

Directive block: directive data and following indented lines (up to
the first blank line) are interpreted as image URI and optional
attributes.

An "image" is a simple picture::

    .. image:: picture.png

The URI for the image source file is specified in the directive data.
As with hyperlink targets, the image URI may begin on the same line as
the explicit markup start and target name, or it may begin in an
indented text block immediately following, with no intervening blank
lines.  If there are multiple lines in the link block, they are
stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and joined together.

Optionally, the image link block may end with a flat field list, the
_`image attributes`.  For example::

    .. image:: picture.jpeg
       :height: 100
       :width: 200
       :scale: 50
       :alt: alternate text

The following attributes are recognized:

``alt`` : text
    Alternate text: a short description of the image, displayed by
    applications that cannot display images, or spoken by applications
    for visually impaired users.
``height`` : integer
    The height of the image in pixels, used to reserve space or scale
    the image vertically.
``width`` : integer
    The width of the image in pixels, used to reserve space or scale
    the image horizontally.
``scale`` : integer
    The uniform scaling factor of the image, a percentage (but no "%"
    symbol is required or allowed).  "100" means full-size.


Figure
======

DTD elements: figure, image, caption, legend.

Directive block: directive data and all following indented text are
interpreted as an image URI, optional attributes, a caption, and an
optional legend.

A "figure" consists of image_ data (optionally including `image
attributes`_), an optional caption (a single paragraph), and an
optional legend (arbitrary body elements)::

    .. figure:: picture.png
       :scale: 50
       :alt: map to buried treasure

       This is the caption of the figure (a simple paragraph).

       The legend consists of all elements after the caption.  In this
       case, the legend consists of this paragraph and the following
       table:

       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | Symbol                | Meaning               |
       +=======================+=======================+
       | .. image:: tent.png   | Campground            |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | .. image:: waves.png  | Lake                  |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | .. image:: peak.png   | Mountain              |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+

There must be a blank line before the caption paragraph and before the
legend.  To specify a legend without a caption, use an empty comment
("..") in place of the caption.


---------------
 Body Elements
---------------

Topic
=====

DTD element: topic.

Directive block: directive data and all following indented lines are
collected.  The first line is interpreted as the topic title; the
second line must be blank.  All subsequent lines are the topic body,
interpreted as body elements.

A topic is like a block quote with a title, or a self-contained
section with no subsections.  Use the "topic" directive to indicate a
self-contained idea that is separate from the flow of the document.
Topics may occur anywhere a section or transition may occur.  Body
elements (including topics) may not contain nested topics.  For
example::

    topic:: Topic Title

        Subsequent indented lines comprise
        the body of the topic, and are
        interpreted as body elements.


Line Block
==========

DTD element: line_block.

Directive block: directive data and all following indented text become
the body of the line block.

The "line-block" directive constructs an element where whitespace
(including linebreaks) is significant and inline markup is supported.
It is equivalent to a `parsed literal block`_ with different
rendering: typically in an ordinary serif typeface instead of a
typewriter/monospaced face.  Line blocks are useful for address blocks
and verse (poetry, song lyrics), where the structure of lines is
significant.  For example, here's a classic::

    "To Ma Own Beloved Lassie: A Poem on her 17th Birthday", by
    Ewan McTeagle (for Lassie O'Shea):

    .. line-block::

        Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday.
        I'm absolutely skint.
        But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back
            as soon as it comes.
        Love, Ewan.


Parsed Literal Block
====================

DTD element: literal_block.

Directive block: directive data and all following indented text become
the body of the literal block.

Unlike an ordinary literal block, the "parsed-literal" directive
constructs a literal block where the text is parsed for inline markup.
It is equivalent to a `line block`_ with different rendering:
typically in a typewriter/monospaced typeface, like an ordinary
literal block.  Parsed literal blocks are useful for adding hyperlinks
to code examples.  However, care must be taken with the text, because
inline markup is recognized; there is no protection from parsing.

For example, all the element names in this content model are links::

    .. parsed-literal::
    
        ((title_,
          subtitle_?)?, 
         docinfo_?, 
         decoration_?, 
         `%structure.model;`_)

Table of Contents
=================

DTD elements: pending, topic.

Directive block: directive data and following indented lines (up to
the first blank line) are interpreted as the topic title and optional
attributes.

The "contents" directive inserts a table of contents (TOC) in two
passes: initial parse and transform.  During the initial parse, a
"pending" element is generated which acts as a placeholder, storing
the TOC title and any attributes internally.  At a later stage in the
processing, the "pending" element is replaced by a "topic" element, a
title and the table of contents proper.

The directive in its simplest form::

    .. contents::

Language-dependent boilerplate text will be used for the title.  The
English default title text is "Contents".

An explicit title, may be specified::

    .. contents:: Table of Contents

The title may span lines, although it is not recommended::

    .. contents:: Here's a very long Table of
       Contents title

Attributes may be specified for the directive, using a field list::

    .. contents:: Table of Contents
       :depth: 2

If the default title is to be used, the attribute field list may begin
on the same line as the directive marker::

    .. contents:: :depth: 2

The following attributes are recognized:

``depth`` : integer
    The number of section levels that are collected in the table of
    contents.  The default is unlimited depth.
``local`` : empty
    Generate a local table of contents.  Entries will only include
    subsections of the section in which the directive is given.  If no
    explicit title is given, the table of contents will not be titled.
``backlinks`` : "entry" or "top" or "none"
    Generate links from section headers back to the table of contents
    entries, the table of contents itself, or generate no backlinks.


Automatic Section Numbering
===========================

DTD elements: pending, generated.

Directive block: directive data and following indented lines (up to
the first blank line) are interpreted as optional attributes.

The "sectnum" (or "section-autonumbering") directive automatically
numbers sections and subsections in a document.  Section numbers of
the "multiple enumeration" form, where each level has a number,
separated by periods.  For example, the title of section 1, subsection
2, subsubsection 3 would have "1.2.3" prefixed.  

The "sectnum" directive does its work in two passes: initial parse and
transform.  During the initial parse, a "pending" element is generated
which acts as a placeholder, storing any attributes internally.  At a
later stage in the processing, the "pending" element triggers a
transform, which adds section numbers to titles.  Section numbers are
enclosed in a "generated" element, and titles have their "auto"
attribute set to "1".

The following attributes are recognized:

``depth`` : integer
    The number of section levels that are numbered by this directive.
    The default is unlimited depth.

Target Footnotes
================

DTD elements: pending, footnote, footnote_reference.

Directive block: unused; directive data must be empty.

The "target-notes" directive creates a footnote for each external
target in the text, and corresponding footnote references after each
reference.  For every explicit target (of the form, ``.. _target name:
URL``) in the text, a footnote will be generated containing the
visible URL as content.

Meta
====

Non-standard element: meta.

Directive block: directive data and following indented lines (up to
the first blank line) are parsed for a flat field list.

The "meta" directive is used to specify HTML metadata stored in HTML
META tags.  "Metadata" is data about data, in this case data about web
pages.  Metadata is used to describe and classify web pages in the
World Wide Web, in a form that is easy for search engines to extract
and collate.

Within the directive block, a flat field list provides the syntax for
metadata.  The field name becomes the contents of the "name" attribute
of the META tag, and the field body (interpreted as a single string
without inline markup) becomes the contents of the "content"
attribute.  For example::

    .. meta::
       :description: The reStructuredText plaintext markup language
       :keywords: plaintext, markup language

This would be converted to the following HTML::

    <meta name="description"
        content="The reStructuredText plaintext markup language">
    <meta name="keywords" content="plaintext, markup language">

Support for other META attributes ("http-equiv", "scheme", "lang",
"dir") are provided through field arguments, which must be of the form
"attr=value"::

    .. meta::
       :description lang=en: An amusing story
       :description lang=fr: Un histoire amusant

And their HTML equivalents::

    <meta name="description" lang="en" content="An amusing story">
    <meta name="description" lang="fr" content="Un histoire amusant">

Some META tags use an "http-equiv" attribute instead of the "name"
attribute.  To specify "http-equiv" META tags, simply omit the name::

    .. meta::
       :http-equiv=Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

HTML equivalent::

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
         content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">

Raw Data Pass-Through
=====================

**NOT IMPLEMENTED YET**

DTD element: pending.

Directive block: the directive data is interpreted as an output format
type, and all following indented text is stored verbatim,
uninterpreted.

The "raw" directive indicates non-reStructuredText data that is to be
passed untouched to the Writer.  The name of the output format is
given in the directive data.  During the initial parse, a "pending"
element is generated which acts as a placeholder, storing the format
and raw data internally.  The interpretation of the code is up to the
Writer.  A Writer may ignore any raw output not matching its format.

For example, the following input would be passed untouched by an HTML
Writer::

    .. raw:: html
       <hr width=50 size=10>

A LaTeX Writer could insert the following raw content into its
output stream::

    .. raw:: latex
       \documentclass[twocolumn]{article}


Restructuredtext-Test-Directive
===============================

DTD element: system_warning.

Directive block: directive data is stored, and all following indented
text is interpreted as a literal block.

This directive is provided for test purposes only.  (Nobody is
expected to type in a name *that* long!)  It is converted into a
level-1 (info) system message showing the directive data, possibly
followed by a literal block containing the rest of the directive
block.
