This document describes the internationalization (hereafter "i18n":
"i" + 18 letters + "n") facilities of the Docutils_ project.
`Introduction to i18n`_ by Tomohiro KUBOTA is a good general
reference.

.. Note::

   The i18n facilities of Docutils should be considered a "first
   draft".  They work so far, but improvements are welcome.
   Specifically, standard i18n facilities like "gettext" have yet to
   be explored.

Docutils is designed to work flexibly with text in multiple languages
(one language at a time).  Language-specific features are (or should
be [#]_) fully parameterized.  To enable a new language, two modules
have to be added to the project: one for Docutils itself (the
`Docutils Language Module`_) and one for the reStructuredText parser
(the `reStructuredText Language Module`_).

.. [#] If anything in Docutils is insufficiently parameterized, it
   should be considered a bug.  Please report bugs to the Docutils
   project bug tracker on SourceForge at
   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=38414&atid=422030.

Language Module Names
=====================

Language modules are named using a case-insensitive language
identifier as defined in `RFC 1766`_.  A typical language identifier
consists of a 2-letter language code from `ISO 639`_ (3-letter codes
can be used if no 2-letter code exists; RFC 1766 is currently being
revised to allow 3-letter codes).  If no language identifier is
specified, the default is "en" for English.  Examples of module names
include ``en.py``, ``fr.py``, and ``ja.py``

Python Code
===========

All Python code in Docutils will be ASCII-only.  In language modules,
Unicode-escapes will have to be used for non-ASCII characters.
Although it may be possible for some developers to store non-ASCII
characters directly in strings, it will cause problems for other
developers whose locales are set up differently.

`PEP 263`_ introduces source code encodings to Python modules,
implemented beginning in Python 2.3.  Until PEP 263 is fully
implemented as a well-established convention, proven robust in daily
use, and the tools (editors, CVS, email, etc.) recognize this
convention, Docutils shall remain conservative.

As mentioned in the note above, developers are invited to explore
"gettext" and other i18n technologies.

Docutils Language Module
========================

Modules in ``docutils/languages`` contain language mappings for
markup-independent language-specific features of Docutils:

``labels``
    This is a mapping of node class names to language-dependent
    boilerplate label text.  The label text is used by Writer
    components when they encounter document tree elements whose class
    names are the mapping keys.

``bibliographic_fields``
    This is a mapping of language-dependent field names (converted to
    lower case) to node classes (in ``docutils.nodes``).  It is used
    when parsing bibliographic fields.

``author_separators``
    This is a list of strings used to parse the 'Authors'
    bibliographic field.  They separate individual authors' names, and
    are tried in order (i.e., earlier items take priority, and the
    first item that matches wins).  The English-language module
    defines them as ``[';', ',']``; semi-colons can be used to
    separate names like "Arthur Pewtie, Esq.".


reStructuredText Language Module
================================

Modules in ``docutils/parsers/rst/languages`` contain language
mappings for language-specific features of the reStructuredText
parser:

``directives``
    This is a mapping from language-dependent directive names to
    canonical directive names.  The canonical directive names are
    registered in ``docutils/parsers/rst/directives/__init__.py``, in
    ``_directive_registry``.
